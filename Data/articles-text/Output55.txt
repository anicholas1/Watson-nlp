executive summary 
this article analyzes numeric trends and demographic characteristics of 
undocumented  border  crossers  (ubcs)  who  have  perished  in  southern 
arizona between 1990 and 2013 in the area covered by the pima county 
office  of  the  medical  examiner  (pcome)  in  tucson,  arizona.  of  2,413 
ubc decedents investigated during this period, 95 percent died after 1999 
and 65 percent after 2005. the rate of ubc deaths in the tucson border 
patrol sector has been consistently high, with an average of nearly 163 

1  this article builds on a 2013 report released by the binational migration institute at the university of 
arizona  which  provided  data  on  migrant  deaths  investigated  by  the  pima  county  office  of  the  medical 
examiner from 1990-2012  (see martinez et al. 2013). it provides updated data on migrant deaths through 
the fiscal year 2013 as well as updated demographic characteristics for migrants who have been positively 
identified since the publication of the 2013 report. this research could not have been possible without the 
dedicated and meticulous work of forensic professionals at the pima county office of the medical examiner, 
now and in the past. the colibr center for human rights has provided invaluable data-management and 
insight.  the  tucson-based  immigrant  rights  organization,  coalicin  de  derechos  humanos,  has  tracked 
migrant deaths in arizona since 2003, providing the groundwork for this research.  studies completed by the 
binational migration institute in the department of mexican american studies at the university of arizona 
in 2006 and 2013 were generously supported by the pima county board of supervisors. the pima county 
board of supervisors has also been very supportive of the pima county office of the medical examiner in 
its efforts to investigate suspected unauthorized border crosser deaths.  we thank m. melissa mccormick 
for her work on the 2006 report. thanks to inez m. duarte and kat rodriguez for their assistance in the data 
collection and data entry process, to jessica hamar martnez and ricardo d. martnez-schuldt for looking 
over early drafts of the article. we also thank the little chapel of all nations for their continued support. 
we gratefully acknowledge the contributions of all those who have worked on the issue of migrant deaths 
for years.

border enforcement during the mid-to-late 1990s, which led to a shifting 
of unauthorized migration flows into more desolate areas, coincided with 
an  increase  in  migrant  remains  investigated  by  the  pcome.  despite  a 
decrease in the number of unauthorized crossers traversing the area as 
measured by the number of border patrol apprehensions in the tucson 
sector, the number of remains examined for every 100,000 apprehensions 
nearly  doubled  between  2009  and  2011.  these  findings  suggest  that 
migrants are being forced to travel for longer periods of time through remote 
areas in an attempt to avoid detection by us authorities, thus increasing 
the probability of death. 
the typical ubc decedent can be described as a male near the age of 30 
from central or southern mexico who perished in a remote area of southern 
arizona after attempting to cross into the united states.  nevertheless, 
the share of non-mexican ubcs in the region has increased notably over 
time.  the  findings  show  other  important  differences  in  ubc  decedent 
characteristics across time periods, which speak to the dynamic nature of 
unauthorized migration as a social process. the authors contend that these 
deaths and demographic changes are the result of structural and political 
transformations over the past two decades. they argue that the tragic, yet 
mostly preventable, migrant deaths in southern arizona constitute a form 
of structural violence.  

introduction
the deaths2 of hundreds of unauthorized migrants each year along the us-mexico border
particularly in southern arizonaremain high despite recent evidence that migration from 
mexico has decreased dramatically since 2007 (passel, cohn, and gonzalez-barrera 2012; 
massey 2012). conservative estimates3 from the us border patrol suggest that at least 
6,029 migrants perished while attempting to cross the border across all sectors between 
october 1, 1997 and september 30, 2013, however the true number of migrant deaths along 
the border is not known. 
this article provides estimates and a demographic profile of migrants who have perished 
in southern arizona between 1990 and 2013 in the area covered by the pima county office 
2  throughout this article we refer to unauthorized border crosser deaths investigated by the pima county 
office of the medical examiner. the term deaths should be taken to mean recovered remains.  this 
distinction must be noted as the true number of migrant deaths in southern arizona each year is not known.  
further, it is possible that remains recovered in a given year may be of an individual who passed away in prior 
years. nevertheless, for the sake of clarity, consistency, and compassion, we use the term deaths rather than 
recovered remains.
3  border patrol counts are considered by many to be incomplete. the clandestine nature of unauthorized 
migration in tandem with local and regional inconsistencies in methodologies used challenge the availability 
of complete counts. although it is almost certain that not every migrant who has died along the border will be 
found, there are vast improvements which can be made at the local, regional, and national levels to increase 
the reliability of such estimates. all data presented in this article pertain to migrant deaths investigated on the 
us side of the us-mexico border and therefore underestimate the true number of migrant death occurring in 
the border region.

legal death investigation for the western two-thirds of the tucson border patrol sectors 
southern border with mexico (anderson 2008).4 the pcome has been responsible for the 
examination of over 95 percent of all migrant remains discovered in arizona since 2003 
(coalicin de derechos humanos 2013). it continues to be the agency that investigates 
the highest number of migrant deaths in the country, and as a consequence, handles more 
unidentified  remains  per  capita than  any  other  medical examiners  office  in  the  united 
states.5  data from the pcome is the most complete and comprehensive source on migrant 
deaths available nationally.6  while the findings cannot be generalized beyond southern 
arizona to other regions of the us-mexico border, they offer greater insight into a social 
problem that has largely remained under-examined. 
multiple interrelated structural and political factors have been identified in the literature as 
contributing to the ongoing humanitarian crisis of migrant deaths in southern arizona: (1) 
border enforcement and securitization practices initiated in the mid-1990s that effectively 
pushed migration flows into the most remote and dangerous regions of the us-mexico 
border (eschbach et al. 1999; cornelius 2001, 2005; rubio-goldsmith et al. 2006); (2) 
neoliberal  economic  reform  during  1990s  that  displaced  hundreds-of-thousands  of 
campesinos throughout mexico (polaski 2004; wise 2009; garcia zamora 2009; public 
citizen 2014); (3) inadequate us immigration policies ill-equipped to deal with realities 
of an increasingly globalized world; (4) the long history and socially-embedded culture 
of migration in many regions of mexico (portes and sensenbrenner 1993); and (5) the 
structurally-embedded demand for immigrant labor in the united states (cornelius 1998). 
while there is insufficient data to test the net effect of the above-mentioned structural 
and political transformations on migrant deaths over time, this paper discusses the ways 
in which border enforcement and neoliberal reform contributed to these deathsboth of 
which it argues constitute forms of structural violence. this paper situates estimates of 
migrant deaths in southern arizona within a broader structural analysis in order to advance 
the understanding of this problems causes, consequences, and solutions by policymakers.  

border  enforcement  and  neoliberal  reform:  migrant 
deaths as a form of structural violence
this  section  examines  the  relationship  of  unauthorized  migration  flows  and  migrant 
deaths to increased border enforcement efforts and neoliberal economic reform initiated 
in the 1990s. patterns in unauthorized migration flows can help scholars to understand 
fluctuations in migrant deaths along the border over time.  although not a precise measure 
of unauthorized crossings, previous research has demonstrated that apprehension statistics 

4  the pcome also conducts some medico-legal investigation of unauthorized migrants who have perished 
in the yuma sector, although this is rare.
5  arizona now ranks third in the nation, following california and new york, for the number of unidentified 
remains  entered  into  the  national  missing  and  unidentified  persons  system  (namus),  but  ranks  first  in 
probable migrant remains and known missing migrants.
6  border patrol estimates, the one data source that does exist on migrant deaths based on systematic data 
collection,  do  not  publically  provide  information  on  demographic  characteristics  of  the  deceased  or  a 
breakdown of causes of death.  

259

migrant deaths in southern arizona are highly correlated and fluctuate with unauthorized migration flows (epenshade 1995).  
figure 1 illustrates us border patrol apprehension statistics along the us-mexico border 
from fy 1960-2013.  these data depict the volatile nature of unauthorized migration and 
how these flows are susceptible to political and economic changes.  
figure 1 shows that the number of apprehensions began to fall beginning in fy 1986, the 
same year that the immigration reform and control act (irca) was passed. following 
irca, scholars estimate that over 2.3 million unauthorized immigrants had gained lawful 
permanent  residency  or  us  citizenship  by  1992  (massey,  durand,  and  malone  2002).  
nevertheless, unauthorized crossing began to increase once again in fy 1990 and only 
declined  for  a  period  of  one  year  in  fy  1994.  this  brief  decline  was  possibly  due  to 
optimism surrounding discussions of the impending north american free trade agreement 
(nafta), but also likely the result of a short-term deterrent effect of operation hold the 
line, an enforcement program implemented by the border patrol in el paso, texas in 
fy 1993. this program was followed by the implementation of operation gatekeeper 
in san diego, california in fy 1994, operation safeguard in southern arizona in fy 
1995, and operation rio grande in south texas in fy 1997.7 although some scholars 
and policymakers contend that the recent decrease in apprehensions is a direct result of 
heightened border security, the present analysis emphasizes the 2000-2001 recession and 
the 2008 great recession as key factors contributing to this decrease. 
as  seen  in  figure  1,  the  sharp  increase  in  apprehensions  between  fy  1994  and  1996 
coincided not only with heightened border enforcement, but also with the implementation 
of nafta in fy 1994. the aim of nafta was to reduce trade barriers between the united 
states, canada and mexico, most notably in the agricultural sector of the economy. after 
the elimination of agricultural tariffs and quotas between the united states and mexico, 
us- based producers continued to receive government subsidies (wise 2010).  this allowed 
us  producers  to  flood  the  mexican  market  with  heavily  subsidized,  cheap  agricultural 
goods  ultimately  displacing  hundreds-of-thousands  of  mexican  laborers.  despite  the 
optimism surrounding nafta, neoliberal economic reform had devastating consequences 
for mexican campesinos as well as others tied to the agricultural sector of the economy.  
as noted by timothy wise, 

below-cost exports cost mexican producers of corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton and 
rice an estimated $9.7 billion from 1997-2005, just over $1 billion per year.  corn 
showed the highest losses.  average dumping margins of 19 percent contributed to a 
413 percent increase in us exports and a 66 percent decline in real producer prices in 
mexico from the early 1990s to 2005. (2010, 3)

nafta ultimately forced campesinosmany the direct descendants of the first people on 
the planet to domesticate cornto abandon farming altogether (public citizen 2014). a 
7  operations hold the line, gatekeeper, safeguard, and rio grande are enforcement programs 
first initiated and deployed by the us immigration and naturalization service in the early 1990s based on a 
prevention through deterrence strategy to immigration enforcement (cornelius 2001; andreas 2009; ewing 
2014). the aim of the operations was to deter would-be migrants by heavily enforcing historical crossing 
corridors near the cities of el paso, texas, san diego, california, nogales, arizona, and in southeastern 
texas. rather than be deterred, border crossers simply shifted their routes into more remote areas of the 
border to avoid detection by immigration enforcement officials (cornelius 2001; andreas 2009).

migrant deaths in southern arizona 2014 report by the nongovernmental organization public citizen, citing a 2008 news story 
by the new republic, states that between 1993 and 2005 1.1 million small farmersand 
1.4 million other mexicans dependent upon the farm sectorwere driven out of work 
as a direct result of neoliberal reform. moreover, [w]ages dropped so precipitously that 
today the income of a farm laborer is one-third that of what it was before nafta (public 
citizen  2014,  21,  citing    judis  2008). a  report  published  by  the  carnegie  endowment 
found that nafta contributed significantly to the loss of an estimated 1.3 million jobs 
in  the  mexican  agricultural  sector  between  1993  and  2002  (polaski  2004,  17-20). the 
link between neoliberalism and increased out-migration has been well-established in the 
academic literature (see nevins and aizeki 2008; delgado-wise and mrquez covarrubias 
2008).  this  structural  transformation  forced  many  people  to  leave  rural  communities 
throughout mexico in search of work in urban areas within the mexican republic, including 
in maquiladoras near the border, and across the border in the united states. 
in addition, the direct link between increased border security and migrant fatalities has 
been  extensively  outlined  in  the  scholarship  on  migrant  deaths  (eschbach  et  al.  1999; 
eschbach, hagan, and rodriguez 2003; cornelius 2001, 2005, 2006; rubio-goldsmith et 
al. 2006; jimenez 2009; martnez et al. 2013). the 1990s and 2000s witnessed dramatic 
increases in the fortification of the us-mexico border as part of the prevention through 
deterrence strategy (dunn 1996, 2009; andreas 1998, 2009; cornelius 2005; ewing 2014) 
and  simultaneous  increases  in  reported  migrant  deaths  in  certain  regions  of  the  border 
(cornelius  2001,  2005;  eschbach  et  al.  1999;  eschbach,  hagan,  and  rodriguez  2003; 
rubio-goldsmith  et  al.  2006).8  previous  research  has  illustrated  that  segmented  border 
militarization has resulted in the funnel effect, or the redistribution of migratory flows 
away from traditional urban crossing points into remote and dangerous areas such as the 
deserts of southern arizona (cornelius 2001, 2005; 2006; rubio-goldsmith et al. 2006; 
jimenez 2009; martnez et al. 2013). the sonoran desert, which spans much of southern 
arizona and northern sonora, mexico, is an ecologically diverse region characterized by 
rugged terrain, pronounced elevation changes, and relatively little rainfall. temperatures 
can reach 120 degrees fahrenheit during the summer months and drop below freezing in 
the winter and, at higher elevations, in the spring and fall as well.  
unauthorized migrants have not always died in high numbers while crossing the border 
into southern arizona. between fiscal years9 (fy) 1990-1997 less than 12 percent of all 
border  patrol  apprehensions  occurred  in  the  tucson  sector  (us  border  patrol  2014).  
during this same time period the pcome only recorded the deaths of 84 undocumented 
border crossers10 (ubcs)averaging around 11 per year. however, one consequence of 

8  eschbach, hagan, and rodriguez (2003) illustrate that migrant deaths across the border did not necessarily 
increase dramatically with heightened border enforcement efforts between 1985 and 2002. rather, there were 
notable changes in specific causes of death as well as where people were dying along the border.
9  in this article all data and figures are reported according to the federal fiscal year which begins on october 
1st and ends on september 30th. this allows for the making of reasonable comparisons between migrant 
deaths and the enforcement efforts of the department of homeland securitys customs and border protection.
10  in this article, the terms undocumented border crosser (ubc) or unauthorized migrant will be used to 
refer to foreign-born, non-us citizens actively involved in crossing the border without proper authorization 
from  the  united  states  government.  because  this  study  does  not  analyze  the  deaths  of  immigrants  who 
are  established  in  the  united  states  and  not  actively  involved  in  crossing  the  border,  the  standard  term 
unauthorized immigrant is not used.

262

journal on migration and human securitythe funnel effect was that the tucson sector became the single most traversed crossing 
corridor for unauthorized migrants along the us-mexico border between fy 1998-2012, 
with 37 percent of all apprehensions occurring in the sector during this time period (us 
border patrol 2014). according to data compiled by border patrol, 38 percent of all known 
migrant  deaths  along  the  entire  border  between  fy  1998-2012  occurred  in  the tucson 
sector.
by the end of fy 2013, the rio grande valley sector in texas (formerly known as the 
mcallen sector) had become the most traversed crossing corridor, with apprehensions in 
that region increasing by 161 percent between fy 2011 and 2013. much of this increase 
has been driven by a surge in central americans crossing through south texas during this 
time period (isacson and meyer 2013).  yet people continue to cross through southern 
arizona in high numbers. in fy 2013 the tucson sector was the second most traveled 
region by ubcs along the entire border, with 120,939 apprehensions or 29 percent of all 
southwestern apprehensions. however, border patrol data suggest that 43 percent of all 
known deaths across the us-mexico border occurred in the tucson sector in fy 2013. 
it is precisely the redistribution of migration flows into southern arizona stemming from 
heightened border enforcement over the past 20 years that has led to an increase in migrant 
remains investigated by the pcome. 
figure  2  illustrates  apprehensions  in  the  san  diego,  el  paso, tucson,  and  rio  grande 
valley  sectors  between  fy  1960-2013.  increased  unauthorized  migration  flowsand 
deathsin  southern arizona  have  been  an  outcome  of  a  series  of  border  enforcement 
efforts that redistributed unauthorized migration flows away from urban crossing points 
into remote desert areas. the implementation of operation hold the line in 1993 in el 
paso and operation gatekeeper in san diego in 1994 coincided with the implementation of 
nafta. this had devastating consequences for displaced agricultural workers in mexico 
seeking work in the united states who were essentially forced to traverse hot, remote, 
dangerous terrain in southern arizona to support themselves and their families.
this paper argues that because migrant deaths result from particular structural and political 
conditions, they constitute a form of structural violence, as first theorized by peace studies 
scholar johan galtung (1969) and later further articulated by medical anthropologist paul 
farmer  (2003),  sociologist  eric  klinenberg  (2002),  geographer  joseph  nevins  (2003, 
2005, 2007), and sociologist david spener (2009). these deaths are representative of what 
paul farmer calls biological reflections of social fault lines, describing the way in which 
violence is manifested on the human body in the form of disease and illness caused by 
social problems (2003,5). they have, like the deaths from the 1995 chicago heat wave 
analyzed by eric klinenberg, a social etiology, which no meteorological study, medical 
autopsy, or epidemiological report can uncover (2002,11).  
galtung argues that because structural violence does not necessarily involve a perpetrator 
and a victim, it is less visible than direct violence.  for this reason, it often goes unnoticed, 
or is seen as about as natural as the air around us (galtung 1969, 173). just like massive 
numbers of deaths from curable diseases, death on the border runs the intellectual risk of 
being medicalizedbroken down into component parts rather than analyzed as a structural 
and structured phenomenon.

journal on migration and human securitygaltung  theorizes  another  form  of  violence,  cultural  violence,  which  he  describes  as 
any aspect of a culture that can be used to legitimize violence in its direct or structural 
form (1990, 291). the dominant discourse surrounding unauthorized migrationnamely 
that migrants willingly cross into the united state without papers and are thus ultimately 
responsible for their own deathsserves as a form of cultural violence that normalizes 
the deaths and blames the victim (galtung 1990; spener 2009). this normalization has 
contributed to a lack of analysis of the causes of these deaths and, in turn, has impeded 
efforts to quantify and track migrant deaths along the border in a transparent manner.   

migrant  deaths  in  southern  arizona:  cause  of  death, 
identification rates, and demographic characteristics
this article provides information from pcome records between 1990 and 2013 on the 
following factors relevant to ubc deaths in southern arizona: confirmed cause of death; 
identification rates; and demographic characteristics including sex, age, and place of origin. 

cause of death

the analysis groups each migrants cause of death into five possible categories: exposure 
to the elements; homicide; motor vehicle accident; other; and undetermined. the use of 
the term cause of death is a deviation from the conventional use by medical examiners 
to  describe  the  disease  or  trauma  that  directly  caused  an  individuals  biological  death. 
examples  of  cause  of  death  as  used  by  medical  professionals  include  exposure  to  the 
elements,  gunshot  wound  of  the  head  and  blunt  force  impact  of  the  torso.  manner  of 
death,  however,  describes  how  the  death  came  about,  and  includes  the  categories  of 
natural,  accident,  suicide,  homicide,  or  undetermined.  strictly  speaking,  the  manner  of 
death for a migrant who was lost or left behind in the desert while crossing and succumbed 
to the elements would be accidental, while the cause of death would be hyperthermia.  for 
the sake of clarity and parsimony, this article uses elements from the definitions of both 
terms to construct the cause of death categories that are most relevant for the population 
under study.  although the analysis includes cases which list other or undetermined as the 
cause of death, the discussion is limited to the differences between exposure, undetermined, 
motor vehicle accident, and homicide as these are the most prevalent causes of death for 
unauthorized migrants attempting to cross the border without proper authorization.  

identification rates

thirty-four percent of all the cases (people) categorized as ubcs by the pcome between 
1990 and 2013 remained unidentified at the publication of this article.  unidentified remains 
pose  a  methodological  challenge  for  researchersthe  issue  of  missing  information.  
successful  identification  is  essential  for  ascertaining  information  for  some  variables  of 
interest in this study. for instance, it is possible to determine the  sex of an unidentified 
individual,  but  impossible  to  establish  their  precise  age  at  the  time  of  death  or  their 
hometown.  because more complete information exists for some variables than for others, 
sample sizes for different factors vary.

migrant deaths in southern arizona demographic characteristics

records from the pcome contain information on important demographic characteristics of 
ubcs who have perished in southern arizona. this article provides estimates of migrants  
sex, age, and place of origin.  as noted above, while  sex is likely to be determined during a 
medical investigation, ascertaining a persons exact age and place of origin are contingent 
upon the success of identification.
the extant literature on unauthorized migration finds that a migrants place of origin plays 
an important role in shaping the reasons people migrate, how and where along the border 
they  may  attempt  a  crossing,  as  well  as  their  desired  destination  (massey,  durand  and 
malone 2002; durand and massey 2003). on place of origin, the present analysis provides 
information on two levels: country-level and region-level.  thirteen different latin american 
countries are represented among the ubc deaths investigated by the pcome; however 93 
percent of decedents originate in mexico, guatemala, el salvador, and honduras, with 82 
percent from mexico.  
the analysis also distinguishes between regions of origin among mexican ubcs. durand 
and  massey  (2003)  identify  four  important  migrant  sending  regions  in  mexico:  north; 
west-central (also known as the traditional or historical region); central; and south-
southeastern. these regional designations are actively used by mexicos consejo nacional 
de poblacin (conapo) when discussing mexico-us migration. this analysis follows 
suit by examining these same sending regions.  in sum, it provides information on mexican 
decedents region of origin while also differentiating between mexican and non-mexican 
ubcs.

data and methods
data  examined  in  this  study  were  collected  from  computerized  decedent  records  of 
unauthorized migrants at the pcome. a team of researchers from the binational migration 
institute (bmi) began compiling data on ubc deaths using pcome records in october 
of 2005 and continue to do so to this day. data analyzed include all known migrant death 
cases investigated by the pcome between fy 1990 and fy 2013 (n = 2,413).  
beginning in 2001, the pcome adopted a new record keeping system that allowed medical 
examiners and investigators to record significantly more detailed information within each 
decedent report.  also at this time, the pcome began to classify individuals believed to be 
unauthorized migrants as undocumented border crossers or ubcs, which, as defined by 
the pcome forensic anthropologist and former chief medical examiner, are individuals of 
foreign nationality who died while crossing the border clandestinely (anderson and parks 
2008). this coding is predictive, meaning it simultaneously weighs several factors before 
classifying a decedent as a ubc, especially when it comes to skeletonized remains. this 
coding scheme allows unidentified decedents matching certain characteristics consistent 
with those of unauthorized migrants in transit to be included in ubc estimates. for the data 
presented in this article, researchers carefully reviewed and scrutinized each individual 
medical investigator report before 2001 and concluded whether or not the individual was 
an  ubc. the  methods  used  to  make  this  determination  follow  the  pcome  criteria  to 
assess whether or not an individual was an unauthorized migrant, as do other studies that 

266

journal on migration and human securityused pcome records (keim et al. 2006; sapkota et al. 2006).
factors  considered  to  determine  ubc  classification  following  the  pcome  criteria 
include, but are not limited to, the individuals place of origin, ethnicity/ancestry, surname, 
possession  of  a  permanent  us  address  or  social  security  number,  clothing  or  personal 
effects (including foreign currency and identification cards), association with a group of 
unauthorized  migrants,  and  geographic  location  of  discovery.  each  case  was  reviewed 
several  times  and  the  decedent  was  only  classified  as  a  ubc  if  significant  supporting 
evidence was present. unidentified skeletal remains recovered from remote high migrant-
traffic areas were considered unauthorized migrants.  
as noted, the coding used by the pcome to classify someone as a ubc is predictive. 
the researchers acknowledge that this may slightly over-represent the number of migrant 
deaths,  however,  to  exclude  data  on  unidentified  ubcs  would  be  to  drastically  under-
report the true number of deaths. it should also be noted that it is impossible to say in 
some instances whether an individual was traveling into mexico rather than out of mexico.  
although likely a rare occurrence, there has been at least one confirmed instance where 
this was the case.

results and discussion

estimated number of deaths

between  fy  1990  and  2013,  the  pcome  examined  the  remains  of  2,413  migrants. 
approximately one-third of these decedents, or 820 cases, remained unidentified at the 
publication of this article, and thus their status as unauthorized migrants is predicted rather 
than  certain. as  discussed  previously,  an  increase  in  border  enforcement efforts  during 
the mid-to-late 1990s redistributed unauthorized migration flows into more desolate areas 
along the us-mexico border, including southern arizona (cornelius 2001, 2005; 2006; 
rubio-goldsmith et al. 2006; martnez et al. 2013). the data from the pcome indicate 
that the number of deaths in the tucson sector remains high.  figure 3 illustrates that the 
funnel effect continues unabated, with an average of nearly 163 deaths occurring each year 
since 1999, while an average of only 12 occurred annually between 1990 and 1999.
while it is possible that skeletonized or highly decomposed remains recovered in one year 
may relate to deaths which occurred in prior years, post mortem intervals (pmi)which 
customarily are reported as the probable range of time lapsing from the time of death to 
the  time  of  recoverysuggest  that  this  is  typically  not  the  norm.  for  instance,  among 
ubc cases in which a pmi was assigned (n = 769), the median low-end estimated pmi 
is six months, while the median high-end estimated pmi is 11 months. in other words, 
while there is certainly some fluctuation in annual ubc death counts in terms of the year 
in which the death occurred, the pcome on average is not investigating deaths of ubcs 
from decades ago (although the mean pmi has increased slightly over the past few years).  
while much media attention is given to marginal changes in migrant death counts from one 
year to the next in southern arizona, the present analysis contends that marginal changes 
should be interpreted with caution. rather, the focus should be on larger overall trends, for 
instance, the fact that ubc deaths have generally remained well above 150 per year since 
2004.

migrant deaths in southern arizona approximate death rate

one could argue that the increase of migrant deaths in southern arizona is simply due to 
an increase in the number of ubcs traversing the area. estimating an approximate death 
rate,  which  simultaneously  considers  deaths  and  migration  flows  in  southern arizona, 
addresses this concern.  the total annual number of known illegal entries into southern 
arizona, which includes apprehensions as well as what border patrol calls got aways 
and turn backs (rosenblum 2013, 23), would be a far better denominator to utilize in 
the calculation of a migrant death rate, but these figures have not been made available 
by the border patrol for the complete time period covered by this study. nevertheless, 
border patrol apprehension statistics can be used in place of the total annual number of 
known unauthorized entries to calculate an approximate death rate. as noted previously, 
scholars have often relied on apprehensions as a proxy for unauthorized migration flows 
(espenshade 1995). 
when  border  patrol  apprehension  statistics  are  taken  into  account,  the  death  rate  has 
actually increased exponentially since 1999. figure 4 shows the number of migrant deaths 
per year standardized to 100,000 border patrol apprehensions each year. these findings 
are  consistent  with  those  of  the  non-governmental  organization  coalicin  de  derechos 
humanos, which reports that the ubc death rate has increased in southern arizona, and 
in fact doubled, between 2009 and 2011 (coalicion de derechos humanos 2012). in fy 
2009, the number of deaths determined to be ubcs by the pcome was 189, while the 
number of apprehensions reported by border patrol in the tucson sector was 241,655.  in 
other words, there were about 78 deaths coded as ubcs by the pcome for every 100,000 
border patrol apprehensions during fy 2009.  although the number of ubcs investigated 
by the pcome decreased from 189 in 2009 to 180 in 2011, the number of apprehensions 
in the tucson sector decreased at a much faster rate during the same period, from 241,655 
to 123,285. this suggests that the number of unauthorized crossers traversing the area also 
decreased substantially between these years.  ultimately, the remains of 146 migrants were 
examined by the pcome for every 100,000 border patrol apprehensions in fy 2011a 
rate nearly twice that of fy 2009.  
overall, these results suggest that migrants are being forced to travel for longer periods of 
time through even more remote areas of southern arizona in an attempt to avoid detection. 
a survey of mexican deportees conducted by the migrant border crossing study of the 
university  of arizona  and  the  george  washington  university  found  that  the  average 
number of days spent crossing in the tucson sector increased from 2.3 days in 2008 to 3.3 
days in 2011. recent accounts documented by the pcome of people traveling with ubcs 
when they were last seen alive also suggest that it is not uncommon for people to spend 
four or five days crossing in southern arizona. in the early 2000s a popular crossing route 
near the city of nogales following the santa cruz river towards tucson would typically 
take less than two nights. however, increased enforcement and a permanent checkpoint 
on interstate-19 have pushed people west on a longer route towards the tohono oodham 
indian reservation through more remote and rough terrain.

271

migrant deaths in southern arizona over 45 percent of confirmed ubc deaths were due to exposure or probable exposure, 
followed by undetermined cause of death (38 percent), motor vehicle accident (8 
percent), other miscellaneous causes (5 percent), and homicide (4 percent). for 
undetermined deaths, the medical examiner was unable to assign a definitive cause of 
death due to the degree of decomposition or lack of compelling evidence of any one 
cause of death. nevertheless, given the remote desert location where these bodies were 
recovered, it is likely that the cause of death for a large percentage of these undetermined 
cases was exposure, but this cannot be confirmed.

the overwhelming majority (80 percent) of decedents were male, with  sex unknown 
in about 3 percent of cases due to the fragmented condition of some skeletal remains 
recovered.  sex also remained undetermined for a handful of cases that were awaiting 
an anthropological examination at the time of publication.  as noted, 820 (34 percent) 
of ubcs examined between 1990 and 2013 remain unidentified.  among people who 
were identified, the mean age was 31 years (median of 30 years). figure 5 represents a 
population pyramid examining the age categories among males and females. about 38 
percent of female ubcs fall in the 20-29 age category, which is comparable to 40 percent 
among males. similarly, 33 percent of female ubcs were between 30 and 39 years of 
age at the time of death compared to 32 percent of male ubcs who fall in the same age 
range.  overall, the typical identified ubc decedent was in the peak of their productive 
years when they died.

as noted in table 1, among those positively identified, migrants from central mexico (22 
percent) are the most prevalent, followed by those from southern mexico (19 percent), 
west-central mexico (15 percent), and northern mexico (13 percent). non-mexicans 
accounted for about 14 percent of the identified decedents. region of origin was 
unknown in 16 percent of cases among ubcs who had been successfully identified.  

table 2 illustrates the breakdown between countries of origin among identified ubcs. as 
noted, the majority of identified ubcs (82 percent) are of mexican origin, followed by 
guatemalans (8 percent), salvadorans (2 percent), and hondurans (2 percent). country 
of origin was unknown in 5 percent of cases of identified ubcs. this is likely due to the 
country of origin category not being updated in pcome records after the successful 
identification of a previously unidentified decedent.  

generally speaking, a typical ubc decedent between fy 1990 and 2013 could be 
described as a male near the age of 30 from central or southern mexico who died of 
exposure while attempting to avoid detection by us authorities. however, as we discuss 
in the next section, there appear to be important differences in causes of death and 
demographic characteristics over time.

changes across time periods: cause of death and demographic 

characteristics
in order to better understand changes over time, the researchers grouped characteristics of 
yearly ubc deaths into three different time periods: the pre-funnel effect era (1990-
1999),  the  early  funnel  effect  era  (2000-2005),  and  the  late  funnel  effect  era 
(2006-2013).  using the same pcome records, rubio-goldsmith and colleagues (2006) 
examined  changes  between  the  pre-funnel  effect  (1990-1999)  period  and  what  they 
termed the funnel effect (2000-2005) period.  the present analysis follows this by re-
examining changes between these time periods while also including an additional period 
(2006-2013).  some of the sample sizes and figures reported in this study may differ from 
those  reported by  rubio-goldsmith et al. (2006)  and  martinez et al. (2013)  due to  the 
positive identification of decedents, confirmed cause of death, the (rare) recoding of deaths 
as non-ubcs, or the (also rare) merging of two cases into one following dna analysis.
although  migration  flows  began  to  increase  in  arizona  between  1993  and  1995  as  a 
consequence of operation gatekeeper and hold the line, there was not a notable increase 
in migrant deaths in southern arizona until after 1999.  this is consistent with prior studies 
which note that although operation safeguard was initiated in the tucson sector in 1994, 
the sector did not receive sufficient funding or resources until 1999 (orrenius 2004, 296; 
cornelius 2001, 664).  in other words, there were essentially two funnels of migration flows 

274

journal on migration and human securitytaking place in southern arizona: first, from san diego, california and el paso, texas to 
the outskirts of nogales, arizona, and then from the outskirts of nogales into the western 
and eastern deserts of southern arizona, with the latter leading to an exponential increase 
in deaths..  while deaths in the region did increase from 8 in 1995 to 21 in 1997a 163 
percent increasethe researchers were cautious to begin the funnel effect era prior to 
2000 due the volatility of small sample sizes. it is possible that certain isolated incidents, 
for instance a motor vehicle accident involving the deaths of multiple people or a larger 
group of migrants getting lost and dying, could influence counts substantially in these early 
years. thus, the researchers opted to mark the beginning of the funnel effect era in 2000 
when the marginal percent increase in deaths from 1999 (19 deaths) to 2000 (71 deaths) 
was 273 percent.  this was the same approach utilized by rubio-goldsmith et al. 2006 and 
martinez et al. 2013.
table 3 illustrates the changes in cause of death, demographic characteristics, and region 
of origin across the three time periods. the number of ubc deaths during each period 
is also reported. asterisks denote that the changes from one time period to the next were 
statistically significant.  data for fy 2013 were omitted from the region of origin analysis 
due to the lag associated with the investigation process which leads to positive identification 
of decedents, and ultimately, more complete information for this variable.
changes in cause of death
most notably for cause of death, the pcome determination of exposure, the leading cause 
of death in the pre- and early funnel effect years, became the second most common cause 
of death after undetermined in the late funnel effect years. individuals who died from 
exposure perished due to hyperthermia or hypothermia, often coupled with dehydration.  
for undetermined deaths, the medical examiner was unable to assign a definitive cause 
of death due to the degree of decomposition or lack of compelling evidence of any one 
cause of death. the state of decomposition may also affect the ability to determine a valid 
postmortem interval which might place the time of death during a specific season. due to 
intensified border enforcement efforts, migrants are increasingly crossing through more 
remote areas in order to avoid detection. for those who die in remote areas, there is a 
longer period of time between death and recovery, which results in more decomposition.  
as previously mentioned, given the desert location where these bodies were recovered, 
it is likely that the cause of death for a large percentage of these undetermined cases was 
exposure, but this cannot be confirmed. however, if exposure and undetermined cause of 
death cases are merged to create one group, these cases make up 82 percent of cases in the 
early funnel effect era and 85 percent of cases during the late funnel effect years. this 
is a much less significant change. 
a significant change between time periods is related to the percent of deaths by motor 
vehicle  accident.  in  the  pre-funnel  effect  years,  1990-1999,  motor  vehicle  accidents 
accounted for 20 percent of ubc fatalities. during this time period, fewer unauthorized 
migrants spent an extended amount of time in remote areas attempting to cross. in the early 
funnel effect years from 2000-2005, the percentage of ubcs who died by motor vehicle 
accident dropped by almost half, to 11 percent, and dropped once again in the late funnel 
effect years to 6 percent. these changes suggest that people have altered their crossing 
strategies as a consequence of increased enforcement, relying less on the use of motor

is  also  possible  that  the  number  of  people  crossing  in  motor  vehicles  has  not  changed 
drastically over the years, but rather the number of those crossing on foot has increased 
substantially between these time periods.  
recently,  notable  media  attention  has  been  paid  to  the  increase  in  cartel  violence 
throughout mexico since former mexican president felipe calderon declared a war on 
drug trafficking organizations (dtos) in december of 2006.  estimates suggest that nearly 
130,000 people have been killed , and more than 27,000 have disappeared in mexico since 
2007 (molloy 2013). a notable portion of the drug cartel-related violence has clustered 
along border crossing corridors and other disputed territories in the northern part of the 
country.  although mexico has a much lower homicide rate (18 per 100,000 residents) than 
other latin american countries such as guatemala, el salvador, honduras, venezuela, and 
colombia (molzahn et al. 2012), some municipalities in the northern mexican states of 
sonora, chihuahua, and tamaulipas have some of the highest homicides rates in the world 
(kronick 2010). this has led to concern over a possible spillover effect of dto-related 
violence into the united states. yet with the exception of a few well-publicized and isolated 
incidents, there is little evidence supporting the notion of a spillover effect. in 2010 ciudad 
jurez, chihuahua, had one of the highest homicide rates in the world, yet its us sister 
city of el paso is one of the safest cities in the country (cq press 2013). pcome records 
suggest the percent of ubcs that have been victims of homicide has remained unchanged 
at 4 percent in both the early funnel effect era and the late funnel effect eraa time 
period that coincides with calderons declaration of the war on dtos in mexico. 
this finding should not be taken as suggesting that unauthorized migrants are not at risk 
of falling victim to dto-related violence during crossing attempts. however, it is likely 
that much of the violence migrants experience tends to be in mexican territory. a recent 
survey of deportees notes that unauthorized migrants are at risk of kidnapping, robbery, 
and assault after deportation by us authorities to mexican border towns (slack et al. 2013).
finally,  it  is  important  to  note  that  the  medico-legal  classification  of  homicide  used 
in this analysis is distinct from homicide in the legal sense of the term. that is, it does 
not disaggregate between criminal homicide, justifiable homicide, or manslaughter.  the 
classification includes migrants who were possibly killed by coyotes (human smugglers), 
bajadores (border bandits), or other migrants, but also consists of migrants who were killed 
during an encounter with us officials. one source notes that 28 people have been killed by 
us customs and border protection agents across the border since 2010 alone (martnez 
2014).  this  is  an  important  distinction  to  make  considering  the  qualitatively  different 
roles these various actors play in the unauthorized migration process. though the present 
analysis does not disaggregate between these types of homicides, a closer examination of 
this distinction warrants future consideration.
changes in demographic characteristics
overall, females account for 17 percent of all ubcs examined at the pcome since 1990 
(see table  1).  however,  there  have  been  significant  changes  in  the  ratio  of  females  to 
males  across  the  three  time  periods. as  noted  in table  3,  approximately  13  percent  of 
ubcs during the pre-funnel effect years were female. this figure jumped to 22 percent 

277

migrant deaths in southern arizona during the funnel effect era, and decreased to 15 percent in the late funnel effect period.  
one of the many consequences of increased border enforcement has been the decreased 
probability  of  migrants  returning  to  their  countries  of  origin,  ultimately  transforming 
would-be seasonal migrants into longer-term settlers (massey, durand, and malone 2002).  
historically, migration from mexico to the united states has been a gendered process, with 
men making up the majority of migrants (donato, wagner, and patterson 2008; wilson 
2010). however, the fact that men are staying in the united states longer has led to an 
increase in the migration of women for the purposes of family reunification, which helps 
explain the increase in female ubcs between the early and funnel effect eras (donato, 
wagner, and patterson 2008). 
the number and proportion of women migrating today appears to have decreased in recent 
years. it is possible that the family reunification process has slowed as more women have 
successfully been reunited with their male family members in the united states over the 
last decade.  us border patrol apprehension data seem to support this notion.  for example, 
in fy 2004 females made up approximately 18 percent of all apprehensions, however, 
this figure fell to 13 percent in fy 2011. nevertheless, apprehensions of females are once 
again on the rise, representing 17 percent of all apprehensions during fy 2013 (us border 
patrol 2014). this increase is likely due to non-mexicans making up a larger share of all 
apprehensions when compared to previous years, an issue which is addressed below.11 
table 3 illustrates that the average age of ubcs has increased from 30 years in the early 
funnel effect period to 32 years in the late funnel effect period (p < 0.05). it is possible 
that interior immigration enforcement programs in effect during this time period, such as 
the federal governments secure communities or state level initiatives such as arizonas sb 
1070, alabamas hb 56, or indianas sb 590 have disproportionately affected older, more 
established migrants residing in the united states rather than younger seasonal workers.  
however, the population of mexico as a whole is aging and birth rates have decreased, so 
it is also possible that this difference, in part, reflects demographic changes occurring in the 
country (the economist 2012; passel, cohn, and gonzalez-barrera 2012). nevertheless, 
further attention should be given to the impact that interior removal programs have had on 
the changing profile of unauthorized border crossers.    

changes in region of origin
there have been notable changes in the regions of origin represented among ubcs. as 
noted,  following  massey  and  colleagues  and  conapo,  the  present  analysis  identifies 
four main mexican sending regions: north; west-central (traditional); central; and south-
southeastern. it also groups non-mexicans together, although the majority of non-mexican 
identified ubcs are from the countries of guatemala, el salvador, and honduras.  
generally speaking, the most significant changes among mexican ubcs in terms of region 
of origin occurred between the pre-funnel effect and early funnel effect time periods.  
in the pre-funnel effect era, around 39 percent of identified ubcs were from northern 
mexico,  however,  this  share  decreased  to  11  percent  in  the  early  funnel  effect  era.  
11  publically available us border patrol apprehensions statistics do not disaggregate other than mexicans 
by sex. 

278

journal on migration and human securitysimilarly, the share of those from the central and south-southeastern region in the earliest 
time period only made up 5 percent and 9 percent of all identified ubcs, respectively. by 
the early funnel effect era, these percentages increased to 25 percent among those from 
the central region and 23 percent among those from the south. this change can likely be 
attributed to increased migration from these regions stemming from the implementation of 
nafta which displaced thousands of rural mexicans (polaski 2004; wise 2009; garcia 
zamora 2009).
changes in the region of origin were less pronounced between the early funnel effect and 
the late funnel effect periods. one exception was the share of ubcs from the northern 
regions, which increased from 11 percent in the early funnel effect era to 14 percent in the 
most recent time period. similarly, the percentage of non-mexicans increased from 9 percent 
to 18 percent between these two periods. a 2005 congressional research service report by 
nuez-neto, siskin, and via notes  that the proportion of non-mexican border crossers has 
been on the rise since the late 1990s. more recent data from us border patrol apprehension 
statistics support this assertion. in fy 2005, roughly 14 percent of all apprehensions were 
of  non-mexicans,  or  what  the  border  patrol  calls  otms  (other  than  mexicans).  by 
fy 2013 this share increased two-and-a-half times to 36 percent across all sectors. the 
proportion of non-mexicans crossing through southern arizona, however, is substantially 
lower than in other areas along the border. a significant number of unauthorized central 
americans travel through mexico atop of freight trains to the tamaulipas-texas border 
and attempt to cross through south texas after crossing the rio grande. nevertheless, the 
proportion  of  non-mexicans  crossing  through  the  sonoran  desert  appears  to  be  on  the 
rise in recent years. for instance, only 3 percent of us border patrol apprehensions in the 
tucson sector in fy 2005 were of non-mexicans, compared to 16 percent in fy 2013 (us 
border patrol 2014).  
overall, non-mexicans appear to be at greater risk for death while crossing the border in 
southern arizona relative to their share of apprehensions in the area. as noted in table 3, 18 
percent of identified decedents between fy 2006-2012 consisted of non-mexican ubcs.  
however, during this same time period, an average of 5.7 percent of apprehensions in the 
tucson sector were of non-mexicans, with a low of 2.4 percent in fy 2006 and a high of 
nearly 15 percent in fy 2012 (us border patrol 2014). the greater distance, effort and 
time required to reach the us-mexico border by non-mexicanswho often must traverse 
multiple international boundariesplaces them in a vulnerable state, leading to increased risk 
of death in the southern arizona desert. abject poverty may also help explain this disparity. 
central american  migrants  often  come  from  impoverished,  marginalized  communities, 
something which greatly limits their ability to secure safe travel northward (hagan 2008).  
finally, the researchers suspect that a relatively larger share of the unidentified and cases 
with unknown region among identified ubcs investigated by the pcome may be non-
mexicans. institutional limitations, scarce economic and social resources among central 
american consulates and families, and strategies utilized by human smugglers transporting 
central americans through mexico to avoid detection all present challenges to successful 
identification and the determination of non-mexican ubcs region of origin.  
all indications suggest that out-migration from central america will persist as the region 
continues to struggle with political instability, abject poverty, gangs, and drug trafficking-

migrant deaths in southern arizona related violence. the researchers anticipate that the share of non-mexicans among ubcs 
in  southern  arizona  will  remain  high  in  the  absence  of  comprehensive  immigration 
reform, sustainable development programs in central america, and expanded channels for 
temporary protection and refugee admissions.      

conclusion
the number of unauthorized border crosser remains examined by the pima county office 
of  the  medical  examiner  has  increased  substantially  since  fy  2000  and  has  remained 
above  150  decedents  per  year  since  2004. this  increase  has  coincided  with  intensified 
enforcement efforts across the border, supporting previous studies which have found that 
border militarization has redistributed migration flows into remote areas, thereby increasing 
the risk of death.  
the  increased  number  of  migrant  remains  examined  by  the  pcome  is  not  simply  a 
consequence  of  more  migrants  crossing  through  southern  arizona.  us  border  patrol 
apprehensions, often used as a proxy for unauthorized migration flows by scholars, have 
decreased over the past several years in the tucson sector.  however, the death rate based 
on border patrol apprehension statistics has increased exponentially since 1999. despite 
a  decrease  in  the  number  of  unauthorized  crossers  traversing  the  area  as  measured  by 
the number of border patrol apprehensions in the tucson sector, the number of remains 
examined for every 100,000 apprehensions nearly doubled between fy 2009 and fy 2011.
this suggests that migrants are crossing for longer periods of time through more remote 
areas to avoid detection by us authorities, thus increasing the probability of death.
remote areas along the california-baja california border experienced notable increases in 
migrant deaths when border enforcement efforts first began in the early 1990s (cornelius 
2001). migrant deaths then appeared to shift east into southern arizona in the early-to-mid-
2000s. this shift is reflected in the near two-fold increase in the number of migrant deaths 
investigated by the pcome between fy 2001 and fy 2002. although migrant deaths and 
the death rate remain near all-time highs in southern arizona, counties close to the south 
texas-tamaulipas border have begun reporting strikingly high numbers of migrant deaths, 
especially considering the size of these counties. for instance, brooks county, which is 
nearly ten times smaller than pima county in terms of geographical area, reported 129 
deaths in calendar year 2012 compared to just 20 in 2010 (maccormack 2013; miroff 
2013). this increase in migrant deaths in south texas is confirmed by data reported by 
the us border patrol, with deaths in the rio grande valley sector increasing from 66 in 
fy 2011 to 156 in fy 2013 (us border patrol 2014). scholars and policymakers alike 
should be concerned with this drastic increase, which appears to be tied to high rates of 
deportations to areas just south of texas as well as an increased number central americans 
crossing clandestinely through south texas (isacson and meyer 2013). 
counties along the texas-mexico border tend to be smaller in terms of area and population, 
and have limited financial and institutional resources with which to investigate migrant 
deaths. further, given the sheer number of counties along the texas-mexico border, it is 
not entirely clear which agency or entity has the responsibility of investigating migrant 
deaths. given these considerations, counties in south and west texas may not be equipped 

280

journal on migration and human securityto properly investigate migrant deaths and disappearances in the area. institutional and 
structural  limitations  will  likely  adversely  affect  the  identification  rate  of  migrants, 
ultimately contributing to an ever-growing list of john and jane does whose remains 
may never be reunited with their family members.    
understanding  the  causes  and  solutions  of  unauthorized  migration  and  migrant  deaths 
requires an understanding of the extent of these phenomena. at present, the true number of 
migrant deaths occurring across the border on an annual basis is unknown. nevertheless, 
the pcome continues to collect reliable and valid data on estimated border crosser deaths 
in southern arizona and, most importantly, is committed to identifying the deceased.  both 
tasks are of paramount importance. the former should help inform policymakers about 
the consequences of immigration and border enforcement policies, particularly in light of 
recent immigration reform proposals calling for even greater border enforcement measures. 
the latter helps provide closure to the families that have lost loved ones who died while 
traversing the sonora-arizona border in search of a better life.  
the public acceptance of significant numbers of migrant deaths on the us-mexico border 
every year for nearly 30 years is symptomatic of cultural violence.  just as in the case of the 
1995 chicago heat wave, we have collectively created the conditions that have allowed so 
many migrants to die, as well as the conditions that make these deaths so easy to overlook 
and forget (klinenberg 2002, 11). summer in arizona does not have to be a season of 
death, and policies that aim to provide security should not result in loss of life.
