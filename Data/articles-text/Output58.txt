executive summary
information  about  the  unauthorized  resident  population  is  needed  to 
develop  and  evaluate  us  immigration  policy,  determine  the  social  and 
economic  effects  of  unauthorized  immigration,  and  assist  public  and 
private  service  providers  in  carrying  out  their  missions.  until  recently, 
estimates  have  been  available  only  for  selected  data  points  at  the 
national and sometimes the state level. the center for migration studies 
(cms)  convened  a  meeting  in  september  2013  to  assess  the  need  for 
information  about  the  unauthorized  resident  population.  the  meeting 
included leading academics, researchers, nongovernmental organizations 
(ngos) that serve immigrants, and local, state, and federal government 
representatives. based on the recommendations from that meeting, cms 
initiated a project to derive estimates of the size and characteristics of the 
unauthorized population at the national, state, and sub-state levels, and 
to make the information readily available to a wide cross-section of users. 
a series of statistical procedures were developed to derive estimates based 
on microdata collected by the us census bureau in the 2010 american 
community  survey  (acs).  the  estimates  provide  detailed  demographic 
information  for  unauthorized  residents  in  population  units  as  small  as 
100,000  persons.  overall,  the  estimates  are  consistent  with  the  limited 
information  produced  by  residual  estimation  techniques.  a  primary 
consideration in constructing the estimates was to protect the privacy of 
acs respondents.

 2014 by the center for migration studies of new york. all rights reserved.jmhs volume 2 number 4 (2014): 305-328introduction
in september 2013, the center for migration studies of new york (cms) convened a 
meeting in washington, dc that linked two important communities in the immigration 
field: (1) leading academics, demographers, and researchers; and (2) non-governmental 
organizations (ngos) that directly serve immigrants, and local, state and federal government 
representatives.  the  meeting,  supported  by  the  john  d.  and  catherine  t.  macarthur 
foundation, focused on the research, information and related tools that government and 
ngo  service  providers  need  to  serve  the  unauthorized  population,  particularly  in  the 
context of a legalization program, whether administrative or legislative.2 cms subsequently 
developed a database and tool that would allow users to create detailed, geographically-
specific  estimates  on  the  unauthorized  from  public  data.  the  database  allows  users  to 
distinguish between legal noncitizens and unauthorized residents and search against all 
available fields in the us census bureaus american community survey (acs) data. this 
article describes the construction of the database and estimates produced by this project. 
despite the inherent difficulty of making estimates for a hidden population, current estimates 
of  the  unauthorized  resident  population  are  considerably  better  than  the  speculative 
estimates made in the 1970s and 1980s. arthur corwin (1982) provides an informative and 
often amusing description of the mostly unsuccessful efforts to determine the size of the 
population during the period from 1970 to 1981. over the past few decades, demographers 
have  made  considerable  progress  in  estimating  the  size  of  the  unauthorized  resident 
population. passel, van hook, and bean (2004) and van hook et al. (forthcoming) provide 
detailed  descriptions  of  the  various  methods  that  evolved  beginning  in  about  the  mid-
1980s. the most widely accepted current estimates rely on residual methods of estimation. 
essentially, the residual method involves subtracting estimates of the legally foreign-born 
resident population from census or survey data for the total foreign-born population; the 
difference, or residual, is assumed to be the population counted in the census or survey. 
usually, adjustments are made to account for under-enumeration. 
the residual method has established the contours of the population: the total population 
is approximately 11 million; just over half are from mexico; many of the rest are from 
central and south american countries; and they are concentrated in the top 10 states, the 
most populous being california and texas. the best evidence indicates that unauthorized 
immigration increased rapidly in most states in the late 1990s to 2000, and then dropped 
steadily after 2001 (warren and warren 2013). the total population has been at or near zero 
growth during the past five years. it is also known that approximately 40 percent of the total 
unauthorized resident population entered with temporary visas and overstayed or otherwise 
violated the terms of their admission (warren 1997).
with  so  much  information  available,  one  might  ask  why  additional  information  about 
unauthorized  immigrants  is  needed. although  significant  progress  has  been  made  over 
the past few decades, it is increasingly clear that the residual method does not provide 
sufficiently  detailed  characteristics  of  the  population  needed  for  many  purposes.  until 
recently, most of the information that has been available about unauthorized immigrants 
has been produced by a handful of statisticians and disseminated in the form of reports that

limited scope of the residual estimates, the quality of the data and assumptions underlying 
the residual method are becoming more tenuous each year.3
the limitations inherent in the residual method have led to efforts in recent years to derive 
individual-level estimates by assigning probable legal status to survey respondents.  passel 
and clark (1998) were the first to provide population estimates of immigrants by legal status. 
the pew research center has used this approach to estimate the social and demographic 
characteristics of unauthorized residents using data from the current population survey 
(cps) sponsored by the us census bureau and the us bureau of labor statistics (passel 
and cohn 2008), and, more recently, from the acs (passel and cohn 2014). capps et al. 
(2013) combined procedures developed by passel and clark, information on legal status 
from the relatively small us census bureau survey of income and program participation 
(sipp), and multiple imputation techniques4 to assign legal status to respondents in the acs. 
in both cases, the results were controlled to a residual estimate of the national population. 
in contrast, the cms project employs a technique of controlling the initial estimatesthe 
number counted in the microdata collected by the acs in 2010to separate independent 
population controls for 145 countries or areas.  comparison of the methods used to construct 
prior estimates with those used by cms is beyond the scope of this paper.  however, the 
analysis of the data indicates that the technique represents a significant improvement in this 
type of approach.

overview of the methodology
the estimates are based partly on the reported characteristics of non-us citizens (henceforth, 
noncitizens) in the microdata of the 2010 acs. the acs is an annual statistical survey 
covering  approximately  one  percent  of  the  total  us  population.  the  survey  gathers 
information previously obtained in the decennial censusthe acs questionnaires are very 
similar to the 2000 census long form. the survey provides detailed social and economic 
data for all states, as well as all cities, counties, metropolitan areas, and population groups 
of 100,000 people or more.
it is assumed that nearly all of the unauthorized resident population contained in the acs 
data is comprised of noncitizens that entered the united states after 1981. very few who 
entered before 1982 would still be residing in the country as unauthorized residents in 2010 
because: (1) a large percentage of those who entered before 1982 obtained legal status 
under the immigration reform and control act of 1986 (irca);5 and, (2) the remainder 
3  for example, in the estimates published by the pew research center and the department of homeland 
security (dhs) in the past few years, legal immigrants admitted more than 30 years ago are survived 
to current dates based on emigration ratesassumed to be applicable to all countries and statesthat are 
increasingly out of date. in addition, the lack of data on internal migration of legal immigrants affects the 
accuracy of the state estimates.
4  see van hook et al. (forthcoming) for an evaluation of the efficacy of using multiple imputation techniques 
to estimate legal status in surveys. 
5  the immigration reform and control act of 1986 (irca) went into effect in 1987. two main groups 
were  eligible  for  legalization,  each  with  their  own  residency  requirements:  legalization  applicants  who 
continuously resided in the united states since before january 1, 1982 and special agricultural workers 
(saws) who had 60 days of seasonal agricultural work experience in qualifying crops from may 1985 to

democratizing data about unauthorized residents in the united stateshave had about 30 years in which to leave the unauthorized resident populationthat is, to 
adjust to legal status, be removed, leave voluntarily, or die. 
the methodology involved three major steps: (1) applying a series of edits, referred to 
here as logical edits, 6 to identify as many legal residents as possible based on responses 
in the survey; (2) deriving separate population controls, for 145 countries or areas, for 
unauthorized residents counted in the 2010 acs; and (3) using those population controls to 
make final selections of individual respondents in the acs to be classified as unauthorized 
residents. the following discussion focuses exclusively on noncitizens that arrived after 
1981 unless noted otherwise. although this discussion focuses on 2010, annual estimates 
were also derived for 2011 to 2013.  the methods used to derive the estimates for all four 
years are described in the appendix.  
a total of 19.9 million noncitizens that arrived after 1981were counted in the 2010 acs.7 
about 10.9 million, or 55 percent, were unauthorized residents (warren and warren 2013). 
based on the logical edits, about 7.3 million of the 19.9 million noncitizens were moved 
into the legal category, leaving 12.6 million as likely unauthorized. finally, we selected 
10.9 million of the remaining 12.6 million to be unauthorized residents using the country-
by-country population controls, as described in the appendix. the technique of controlling 
the likely unauthorized population to 145 country controls produced estimates by age, year 
of entry, and state of residence that are very similar to the best available residual estimates.
the  final  step  in  the  methodology  was  to  adjust  the  estimates  for  under-enumeration. 
as described in detail below, the data was adjusted using the same methodology used to 
construct residual estimates by state (warren and warren 2013). the most recent entrants 
are assumed to have the highest undercount rates (about 12 percent), and the undercount 
rate drops steadily with length of residence, falling to two percent for those who entered 
in 1982. the estimated undercount rate for the total population is about 7.5 percent. the 
appendix shows additional details.
for most countries the logical edits produce numbers that are fairly close to the control 
totals. however, the logical edits do not shift all of the legal residents out of the likely 
unauthorized category. as a result, a small percentage of those remaining in the database 
actually  are  legal  residents.  however,  a  sizeable  proportion  of  these  legal  residents 
had previous experience as unauthorized residents. overall, the database consists of an 
estimated 89 percent unauthorized residents, but adding in those with previous unauthorized 
experience raises the total to 93 percent. the appendix shows how these percentages were 
computed and provides more detail.   

may 1986. about 1.6 million legalization applicants and 1.1 million saw applicants were approved.
6  the term logical edit refers to the process of determining probable legal status by examining survey data. 
respondents were assigned to the legal category if they worked in occupations that generally require legal 
status, were legal temporary migrants, were immediate relatives of us citizens, received public benefits, 
were from countries where most arrivals would be refugees, or were age 60 or older at entry. this method 
was developed by jeffrey passel and rebecca clark (1998), extended by passel, bean and van hook (2004), 
and refined by passel and others in recent years at the pew research center.
7  natives of cuba are omitted because in most cases they are eligible to apply for legal status under the 
cuban adjustment act.

journal on migration and human securitysources of data
the  estimates  for  each  country  used  as  population  controls  for  the  2010  estimates  are 
based partly on administrative data from the department of homeland security (dhs), 
estimates and assumptions consistent with warren and warren (2013), and a variety of 
other sources, including foreign-born data from the 2000 census, legalization applications 
by country from irca, and estimates of nonimmigrant overstays, by country, derived by 
dhs annually from 1988 to 1992. the appendix provides a more complete description of 
the data and methods used to derive the population controls for 145 countries or areas for 
2010 as well as the annual estimates for 2011 to 2013. 
public-use samples of individual survey records from the acs were tabulated to provide 
the data used in the estimation process. the public-use file is a representative one percent 
sample of the entire us (including about three million individual records for 2010) obtained 
from the integrated public-use microdata series, or ipums (ruggles et al. 2010).

validation of the results

comparisons with other estimates

comparisons with other estimates address the issue of face validity that is, do the 
estimates generated by this method conform generally to the accepted parameters of the 
unauthorized  resident  population?  the  first  comparisons,  between  the  cms  and  dhs 
estimates in table 1, are not a test of the overall database; they are a comparison of cms 
population  controls,  by  country,  with  dhs  residual-based  estimates. this  section  later 
shows  how  estimates  compiled  from  this  database  compare  to  other  widely-accepted 
residual estimates.
based on the comparisons shown, the estimates described in this paper are consistent with the 
best current estimates of the unauthorized resident population. although all methodological 
approaches  have  inherent  errors,  the  close  correspondence  between  estimates  derived 
from such disparate approaches indicates that they are measuring approximately the same 
population.

population controls compared to dhs estimates

cms chose to control the final results to estimates by country of origin, rather than states, 
because residual estimates for states are subject to error due to the lack of information 
about internal migration of legal residents.8 unfortunately, estimates by country of origin 
were available for only a few countries at the beginning of this project. table 1 shows a 
comparison between the cms population controls and dhs estimates for their top ten 

8  in the residual estimates for states, net out-migration of legal residents from entry to the survey date will 
produce underestimates of the population; net in-migration will produce overestimates. to produce accurate 
estimates for california, for example, it would be necessary to know the cumulative net migration of legal 
immigrants in every year from 1980 to the survey date. residual estimates by country of origin are unaffected 
by the lack of data on internal migration.

estimates for these ten countries are important because they make up more than 80 percent 
of the unauthorized resident population.

cms estimates compared to published estimates for 2010

this section compares the estimates compiled from the database described here for 2010 
with estimates for 2010 derived using the residual method. note that in tables 2, 3, and 4 
the cms estimates are compilations of microdata, with the exception of the cms estimate 
for mexico in table 2. the estimate for mexico is a control total computed as described in 
the appendix. 
the estimates shown in columns 2, 3, and 4 of table 2 are based on estimates derived 
by warren and warren (2013), dhs (baker and rytina 2013), and pew research center 
(passel and cohn 2013), respectively. the cms estimates for 2010 shown in table 2 are 
generally consistent with those estimates, which were derived using the residual method. 
some differences among the estimates are to be expected considering the diverse data and 
methods used to construct the estimates. the important point is that the cms estimates 
described here for 2010 fit well with the best available residual estimates.

democratizing data about unauthorized residents in the united statesage distribution

the  age  distribution  of  the  unauthorized  resident  population  derived  here  for  2010  is 
similar to the published dhs estimates for 2012 (table 3). in both sets of estimates, about 
83 percent of the population is under age 45. the dhs estimates have relatively fewer 
under age 25 (22 percent compared to 27 percent) and more in the 25 to 44 age range (61 
percent compared to 56 percent). the percentages in the 45 to 54 and the 55 and over age 
ranges are identical (table 3).

year of entry

comparable  estimates  of  unauthorized  immigration  by  period  of  entry  are  not  readily 
available because of differences9 in data and methodology, and because the distributions 
by period of entry can change in just a few years. nevertheless, the figures shown in table 
4 are roughly comparable for the time periods shown.

estimates for states

table 5 shows estimates compiled from the cms database for every state and the district 
of columbia along with estimates derived by warren and warren (2013) using the residual 
method. the two distributions of unauthorized residents are remarkably similar considering 
the fundamental differences in the methods of estimation. note that the cms estimates 
for each state shown in table 5 were not controlled to marginal state controls; they are 
compilations from the cms database.

9  for example, the estimates in table 4, column 3 were derived from cps data controlled to estimates based 
on updated 2000 census data, while the data in columns 2 and 4 were derived from acs data controlled to 
2010 census data. note also that data are not shown for the 2005 to 2009 period for pew 2009 and dhs 2012 
because (a) the pew estimates refer to march 2009, so the period is incomplete; and (b) the source of the dhs 
2012 estimates, table 1, shows only the 2005 to 2011 period.

democratizing data about unauthorized residents in the united statesunauthorized resident population in 2013
the main purpose of this article is to describe the construction of the database. however, this 
article includes the estimates shown in tables 6 and 7 to illustrate the kinds of information 
that can be compiled. table 6 shows the states that have the highest number of unauthorized 
residents from the countries listed under the state. for example, even though many states 
have large numbers from mexico, california has the largest population from mexico, about 
30 percent of the total number in the united states (table 6). as might be expected, illinois 
has the highest number of unauthorized residents from poland (44 percent).

table 7 shows estimates of the unauthorized resident population for three major sending 
areas in the western hemisphere, cross-classified by the top six states of residence of the 
unauthorized resident population for each year from 2010 to 2013. the annual estimates for 
large sending areas and the top six states indicate that, at least at this level of aggregation, 
the methodology produces stable results from year to year. the total population declined 
each year from 2010 to 2013, but the rate of decline slowed each year. the population from 
mexico fell by about a half million from 2010 to 2013, a reduction of about eight percent. 
population decline was the largest for south american countries; the population dropped 
from 820,000 in 2010 to 640,000 in 2012, a decline of 180,000, or 22 percent, in just two 
years. the population from central america was largely unchanged from 2010 to 2013.

democratizing data about unauthorized residents in the united statesdiscussion 

uses of the data

this data should be useful for many purposes, from planning and evaluating changes in 
us immigration policy to assisting states, counties, cities, and private entities that serve 
immigrants. although much attention is currently focused on president obamas executive 
actions to defer deportation of millions of unauthorized residents, the information in this 
database will be particularly valuable to service providers at the local level.10 for example, 
the data tool will provide information about unauthorized residents at the local level for 
such variables as age, gender, years in the us, languages spoken, ability to speak english, 
educational attainment, occupation, poverty status, and legal status of parents and children. 

executive action 

on november 20, 2014, president obama announced a series of executive actions that 
included temporary relief from deportation (referred to as deferred action) for millions 
of unauthorized residents. the cms database was used to derive estimates for the groups 
most  affected  by  president  obamas  executive  actions.11  the  largest  group  consists  of 
unauthorized  residents  whose  children  are  us  citizens  or  lawful  permanent  residents 
(lprs).12 the estimation shows that a total of 3.9 million13 unauthorized residents could 
qualify  under  this  provision. the  second  group  consists  of  unauthorized  residents  who 
were under age 16 when they arrived and are eligible for the deferred action for childhood 
arrivals (daca) program. the revision in the daca eligibility requirements announced 
on november 20 added about 235,000 to the number eligible for daca. thus, the actions 
announced  on  november  20  added  a  total  of  about  4.1  million  to  the  number  eligible 
for deferred action. approximately one million already were eligible for daca when the 
program was announced in 2012. altogether, about 5.1 million unauthorized residents have 
been offered deferred action. cms will make estimates of the unauthorized population 
eligible for deferred action available at the state and local levels to assist service providers 
in implementing the provisions of these actions.  

local area data 

organizations  that  provide  services  to  immigrants  will  need  the  following  kinds  of 
information available from this database: the number of unauthorized residents in the area, 
their countries of origin, their ability to speak english, which languages they speak, how 
10  in this context, local level refers to areas that have approximately 100,000 or more total residents.
11  the first major executive action, announced on august 15, 2012, established the deferred action for 
childhood arrival (daca) program. the second, on november 20, 2014, expanded the number eligible for 
daca and also provided temporary relief from deportation to unauthorized residents who entered the us 
before 2010 and are parents of us citizens or lawful permanent residents (lprs).
12  lprs are foreign-born persons authorized by dhs to reside permanently in the united states. they are 
sometimes referred to as green card holders. 
13  the estimated total for this group, 3,885,000, is composed of the following: (1) 3,475,000 parents who 
have a us citizen child, but no lpr children; (2) 270,000 parents who have an lpr child, but no us citizen 
children; and (3) 140,000 parents who have both a us citizen child and an lpr child.

316

journal on migration and human securitymany children they have, what percent are living below the poverty level, and (beginning 
with the 2013 estimates) how many have access to a computer or the internet. to make sure 
that such local-area data are viable, the estimates were evaluated by comparing them to the 
best and most detailed information available. 

strengths and limitations of the cms data

there are several strengths of the cms data:
1.  controlling the data (after the logical edits) for 2010 to control totals for 145 countries 
or areas is a new and important step in constructing estimates of the unauthorized. the 
estimates produced by applying this technique are consistent with other information 
available about the unauthorized resident population.

2.  unauthorized  residents  constitute  a  high  percentage  of  the  population  included  in 
the cms database, as described in the appendix, making it an excellent resource for 
researchers, policymakers, and ngos service providers.

3.  the large sample size of the acs makes it possible to compile data for unauthorized 

residents for geographic areas with population sizes of 100,000 or more.

4.  the individual-level data available from the acs makes it possible to measure the social 
and economic conditions of the unauthorized resident population for such variables as 
income, education, health care coverage, and language usage.

5.  the methods used to construct the database for 2010 and 2011 can be used for several 

years to produce similar annual estimates based on acs data (see appendix).

potential limitations include:
1.  although  the  cms  database  contains  a  high  percentage  of  unauthorized  residents, 
inevitably some legally resident noncitizens are also included. however, as explained 
below, this variation in percent unauthorized by country of origin should have little 
effect on estimates of unauthorized residents compiled for most purposes.

2.  although the logical edits have been reviewed carefully, misclassification errors are 
inevitable. in cases where some error would occur regardless of the choice for a logical 
edit, cms made the choice that was likely to introduce the least amount of error. for 
example, all noncitizens who were aged 60 and over at entry are assumed to be legal 
residents. while a small number could have been unauthorized, the available evidence 
indicates that very few unauthorized residents arrive at ages 60 and over. 

3.  the data are based on a sample, and sampling variability must be taken into account, 

especially as the size of the population or the geographic area under study decreases.

4.  if comprehensive legislative reform were to be enacted, the logical edits described here 
would have to be reviewed and revised. it is possible that the characteristics specified 
in the legalization program could be used to modify the methodology so that estimates 
could continue to be made.

democratizing data about unauthorized residents in the united statesprivacy of respondents

 a  primary  consideration  in  this  project  was  the  protection  of  the  privacy  of  all acs 
respondents.  in  most  cases,  access  to  the  information  about  unauthorized  immigrants 
will be limited to the creation of tables through the cms website. in rare cases, the acs 
microdata used to compile tables might be made available, but only upon request, after 
consultation with expert advisors, and after the establishment of a confidentiality (non-
sharing) agreement.    
from a demographic perspective, the possibility of identifying individuals or groups of 
unauthorized immigrants from the database is extremely unlikely for three primary reasons:
the  annual acs  is  an  approximately  one  in  100  sample,  and  the  cms  estimates  are 
restricted to areas with population sizes of 100,000 or more. in a population that large, 
individuals or small groups of unauthorized residents are likely to be indistinguishable 
from legal foreign-born residents.
almost three quarters (73 percent) of the total foreign-born population in the united states 
are legal residents. the legally resident foreign-born population outnumbers unauthorized 
residents in every state and the district of columbia, making it extremely unlikely that 
individuals or groups of unauthorized residents can be distinguished from legal foreign-
born residents. 14 in the 10 states with the lowest numbers of unauthorized residents, more 
than 90 percent of the foreign-born population consists of legal residents.
as with the residual estimates of unauthorized residents, this database contains a small 
percentage of legal residents, making it unlikely that any particular population group is 
composed exclusively of unauthorized residents.

sampling variability
estimates  of  sampling  variability  will  be  available,  along  with  the  estimates  of  the 
unauthorized  resident  population,  at  the  cms  website:  http://cmsny.org.  a  detailed 
discussion  of  the  accuracy  of  2010  pums  data,  including  measures  used  to  assure 
confidentiality, weighting and estimation, measuring sampling error, and design factors, is 
available from us census bureau (2010) at: http://www.census.gov/acs/www/downloads/
data_documentation/pums/accuracy/2010accuracypums.pdf.

conclusion
the database developed by cms makes it possible for a broad cross-section of users to 
tabulate detailed geographic, social and economic data on the unauthorized and compare that 
data to variables collected in the acs.  historically, most of the information that has been 
available about unauthorized immigrants has been produced by a handful of statisticians 
and disseminated in the form of reports that show selected data points at the national and 
sometimes the state level. the cms database produces estimates that are highly consistent 

14  for each state, the source of data for unauthorized residents is warren and warren 2013, and the source of 
data for total foreign-born population by state is the 2010 acs data from ipums.

318

journal on migration and human securitywith the most widely-accepted estimates derived using the residual estimation methods 
while providing detailed information for each figure at population units as small as 100,000 
persons. 
the  idea  of  democratizing  access  to  data  on  legal  and  unauthorized  residents  has 
overwhelming  advantages  for  policymakers,  government  entities,  and  ngos  that 
legislate, craft, implement and evaluate programs that serve immigrants. in the context 
of a legalization program, detailed, sub-state data will allow stakeholders to determine: 
(1) how to allocate resources, including staffing; (2) which populations would likely need 
assistance with fees and would struggle to meet income requirements; (3) where to expand 
charitable legal service capacity and english language classes; (4) how to conduct outreach, 
in what languages and where; and (5) which immigrants might have other relief available. 
estimates from the cms database will assist service providers at the state and local levels 
in implementing provisions of executive action by the obama administration, and state and 
local integration initiatives. 

appendix. detailed methodology

this section first describes the methods used to derive estimates of the unauthorized resident 
population counted in the 2010 acs. the final step was an adjustment for undercount. 
before beginning the estimation process, the data is adjusted for misreporting of citizenship. 
for  2010,  foreign-born  persons  who  arrived  from  2007  to  2010    and  reported  being 
naturalized  were shifted to the noncitizen category.15
the estimates are based partly on the characteristics of noncitizens reported in the microdata 
of the 2010 acs. it is assumed that nearly all of the unauthorized immigrant population 
is in the acs data for noncitizens who entered the us after 1981 because (a) pre-1982 
entrants could have legalized under irca and (b) those who did not do so have had 28 
years in which to leave the unauthorized resident population.16 

step 1. logical edits

the first step examined individual characteristics reported in the survey, comparing them 
to other data and assumptions, to identify those who are likely to be legal residents. the 
responses of all noncitizens that arrived after 1981 were examined to determine whether 
they were in any of the following categories: 

15  although there are exceptions, for example marriage to a us citizen or serving in the military, immigrants 
must reside in the country for five years before they can become naturalized citizens.
16  choosing 1982 as the starting date is an example of making the assumption that is likely to produce 
the least error. including 1980 and 1981 entrants, as others have done, probably would have added a small 
number of unauthorized residents, but it most likely would have added an even greater number of legal 
noncitizens to the database, especially since the acs data for entrants in 1980 are subject to heaping. 

319

democratizing data about unauthorized residents in the united statesc)

a) occupations that require legal status. examples include lawyers, judges, police,
firefighters, and pilots. others in this group included government workers, veterans,
active  members  and  employees  of  the  armed  forces,  and  their  dependents.
b) legal  temporary  migrants.    noncitizens  in  this  category,  often  referred  to  as
nonimmigrants,17  were  selected  based  on  their  date  of  entry  and  on  certain
educational and occupational characteristics. those who are likely to be enumerated
in censuses or surveys are included; tourists and other short-term visitors are not.
immediate  relatives  of  us  citizens.  noncitizens  who  were  immediate  relatives
of  us  citizens  were  assumed  to  be  legal  residents  except  noncitizens  from
mexico,  el  salvador,  guatemala,  and  honduras  who  arrived  after  2000.18
d) receiving  public  benefits.  noncitizens  were  classified  as  legal  if  they  reported
receiving public benefits  that are restricted to  legal residents. examples include
medicare,  social  security,  medicaid  (for  certain  recipients19),  supplemental
security  income (ssi),  and  temporary assistance  for  needy  families  (tanf).
e) age  60  or  older  at  entry.    respondents  who  were  60  years  old  or  older  in
the  year  they  entered  the  us  were  considered  to  be  legal  residents  in  the  2010
acs.  this  assumption  is  based  on  work  by  passel  and  cohn  (2010)  and  on
estimates of unauthorized residents by age published by dhs (2013). in the dhs
estimates,  4.5  percent  of  all  unauthorized  residents  were  55  years  and  older;  in
the  estimates  derived  from  the  cms  data,  4.7  percent  are  55  years  and  older.
f) from refugee countries. if the number of refugees was double the number of
new arrivals from a country in a particular year (based on dhs data), the arrivals
for  that  country/year  were  assumed  to  be  legal  residents  in  the  2010  acs.

as a result of the logical edits, a total of 7.3 million noncitizens who entered the us after 
1981 were judged to be legal residents. after the 7.3 million were shifted into the legal 
category, about 12.6 million remained in the likely unauthorized category. at that point, 
about 86 percent (10.9 million of 12.6 million) of the noncitizens remaining in the database 
were unauthorized residents.

step 2. population controls for each country

the next major step in the methodology was to derive independent population controls by 

17  nonimmigrants are non-us citizens who are admitted legally to the united states for specified, temporary 
periods.  examples include tourists, students, foreign government officials, and temporary workers and their 
families.
18  this exception was made because unauthorized immigrants who entered the us after 2000 from these 
countries are more likely than others to be subject to the three- and ten-year bars, which prohibit applicants 
from returning to the united states if they entered the us illegally (that is, they entered without inspection, 
most likely across the southern border). note that noncitizens that entered the us after 2000 from these 
four countries are not automatically assumed to be unauthorized residents; they could be classified as legal 
residents as the result of any of the logical edits.
19  the following noncitizen medicaid recipients were classified as legal residents: men age 19 and over; and 
women age 19 and over who had not had a child in the previous year.

320

journal on migration and human securitycountry of origin. for this project, estimates of the unauthorized resident population from 
145 countries20 or areas of origin were needed; unfortunately, such estimates were available 
for  only  a  few  countries.  a  variety  of  demographic  techniques  were  used,  including 
residual estimation procedures, to derive a complete set of estimates. the residual method 
alone could not produce acceptable estimates for every country primarily because detailed 
information about emigrationwhich can vary considerably by countryis not available. 
therefore, other relevant data, described below, were used to ensure that the estimate for 
each country fell within a plausible range. the total number of 10,850,000 counted in the 
2010 acs is based on estimates by warren and warren (2013).21

* the provisional estimates covered the 1986 to 2009 period, rather than the 1982 to 2010 period, because 
detailed data for lprs by country of origin were not readily available from the dhs website for years prior 
to 1986. the steps taken to convert the provisional estimates to final estimates generated estimates for the 
entire unauthorized resident population.    

20  hereineafter, to simplify the description, the terms 145 countries, or each country, or all of the 
countries are used to refer to the individual countries or areas for which estimates of the unauthorized 
resident population were derived. the countries or areas are listed in ipums for 2010 (country codes 15000 
to 71042).
21  see warren and warren 2013 for the methodology used to estimate the number of unauthorized residents 
counted in the 2010 acs. the estimate of 10,850,000 counted in the 2010 acs was derived by following the 
same procedures described in that report but without any adjustment for undercount.  

321

democratizing data about unauthorized residents in the united statesprovisional estimates were derived for 145 countries using the residual method, as illustrated 
in table a-1. then, an extensive analysis and evaluation of the estimates for each country 
was undertaken. the provisional estimates were adjusted so that they fell within certain 
demographic guidelines. for example, the final estimate for a country could not exceed the 
number derived in step 1 for that country. also, estimates of the percent of unauthorized 
to foreign-born in 2000 and 2010, by country, were used to calibrate the estimates. finally, 
two other sets of data were used as indirect indicators of the general magnitude of the 
unauthorized resident population from various countries and regions of the world: (1) the 
country-by-country distribution of the three million applicants under irca; and (2) dhs 
annual estimates of nonimmigrant overstays for every country from 1988 to 1992 (see 
bean, edmonson and passel 1990; gao 1995).

step 3. selection of unauthorized residents counted in the acs

step 3 selected the individual respondents to be included in the database. after applying the 
logical edits to compile the number of likely unauthorized residents, by country, a random 
process was used to select the appropriate number, i.e., the population control, for each 
country. for mexico, for example, 8.1 million noncitizens arrived after 1981; about 1.6 
million were judged to be legal residents based on the logical edits (step 1), leaving 6.4 
million as possible unauthorized residents. the control total for mexico was 6.1 million 
(step 2). in step 3, about 6.1 million, or 95.6 percent, of the 6.4 million were randomly 
selected to be in the database. those not selected were classified as legal residents. overall, 
a total of 10.9 million as unauthorized residents were selected; the remaining 9.1 million 
noncitizens who arrived after 1981were classified as legal residents. after this selection 
process was completed, about 89 percent of the total consisted of unauthorized residents.22
table a-2  illustrates  the  estimation  procedure  for  south american  countries.  the  first 
three columns in the table represent the first major step in the methodology. the procedure 
began with total noncitizens (column 1) and then identified legal noncitizens based on the 
logical edits (column 2). column 3 shows the number remaining as likely unauthorized 
residents after the logical edits. the population controls for each country are shown in 
column 4. note that in the unlikely event that the logical edits had identified all of the legal 
noncitizens, the numbers in columns 3 and 4 would have been identical.
the numbers included in the cms database were derived by randomly selecting (from 
the microdata) the numbers shown in column 4 from those in column 3 (table a-2). for 
brazil, for example, 130,000 (column 4) of the 145,000 in column 3 were selected to be 
in the database. to summarize the procedures for estimating the number counted in 2010: 
the number of noncitizens who entered from each country after 1981was compiled; the 
procedures described above (logical edits) were used to move some of them into the legal 
category; and the remainder was controlled to country-by-country population totals. the 
process was repeated for 145 countries or areas.

22  table a-5, items a, b, and c, illustrates how this percent was computed for each country.

annual estimates for 2011 to 2013

the method of constructing the database for unauthorized residents in 2011 is illustrated in 
table a-3. note that columns 1, 2, and 3 were compiled from 2011 acs data in the same 
way as columns 1, 2, and 3 in table a-2 above. the percents in column 4 of table a-3 are 
the same percents shown in table a-2, column 5. in essence, it is assumed that the logical 
edits shift the same percent of the noncitizen population into the legal category in 2011 as 
they did in 2010; that is, they produce the same percent unauthorized in 2011 as they did 
in 2010.23 
the estimates of unauthorized residents in 2011 (table a-3, column 5) were derived by 
multiplying the percent unauthorized in column 4 by the likely unauthorized population, 
that is, the number of noncitizens remaining after the logical edits (column 3). then, the 
numbers in column 5 were randomly selected from the figures in column 3. the same 
estimation procedures used for 2011 were used to derive estimates for 2012 and 2013. 
an important aspect of the estimation procedure for 2011 and subsequent years is that it 

23  under this assumption, the estimated unauthorized resident population varies from year to year in response 
to changes in the logically-edited (i.e., mostly unauthorized) noncitizen population.

democratizing data about unauthorized residents in the united statesdoes not rely on administrative data or residual estimates. in addition to avoiding the errors 
inherent in that data, estimates for the most recent year of acs data can be derived using 
this estimation procedure as soon as the public-use data become available.

adjustment for undercount

the estimates were adjusted for undercount using the approach described by warren and 
warren (2013). the undercount rate is relatively higher for recent arrivals than for those 
who have been in the us the longest. unauthorized residents who arrived in the five years 
before the survey were adjusted by about 12 percent; those who entered before 1986 were 
adjusted by about 2 percent. the undercount rate used here dropped by about 25 to 30 
percent for each additional five years of residence in the us24 the adjustments were made 
by re-weighting the microdata based on year of arrival from 1982 to the survey date. the 
result for 2010 is a total population of 11,725,000, the total number estimated by warren 
and warren (2013). the estimated undercount rate for the total population is 7.5 percent.  

24  specifically, for the 2010 estimates, those who entered in 2010 and 2009 were adjusted for undercount by 
13.2 percent; that rate dropped by 7 percent each year, falling to 1.9 percent for those who entered in 1982.

journal on migration and human securityoverall percent unauthorized 

as shown in table a-2 above (column 5), for most countries the logical edits produce 
numbers that are fairly close to the control totals.  however, a small percentage of those 
selected for the database are erroneously classified as unauthorized residents. many of these 
legal residents who are misclassified as unauthorized actually had previous experience as 
unauthorized residents (see table a-4). therefore, they probably would have characteristics 
similar to unauthorized residents. 
data  from  the  1996  dhs  longitudinal  study  of  legal  immigrants  (jasso  et  al.  2008) 
indicates that a sizeable proportion of those who attain lpr status have spent time in an 
unauthorized status at some time in the past. as shown in table a-4, almost one-third of 
those who became legal permanent residents in fiscal year 1996 had previous unauthorized 
experience in the united states.

for the 1996 cohort of lprs, the percent with previous unauthorized experience varied 
by country and continent of origin. for mexico and el salvador, the percents were 74 
percent and 65 percent, respectively (table a-4). for north and south america combined, 
approximately half of the 1996 cohort of lprs had previous unauthorized experience. the 
percents from africa, europe, and asia, ranging from 13 to 23 percent, were lower than 
those from the western hemisphere.
table a-5 shows the computation of the percent unauthorized, as well as the percent that 
had previous unauthorized experience, for el salvador in 2010. based on random selection, 
about 87 percent of the 570,000 unauthorized residents from el salvador in the database 
for 2010 are likely to be unauthorized residents (item c). adding the number who probably 
were legal but had previous unauthorized experience (item g), the percent of salvadorans 
in the database who were unauthorized or had previous unauthorized experience increases 
to 96 percent (item i). replicating table a-5 for each country and summing across all 
countries yields a total of 89 percent unauthorized; adding legal residents who had previous 
unauthorized experience to those estimated to be unauthorized yields an overall total of 93 
percent.

the  percent  unauthorized  varies  by  country;  the  countries  with  the  largest  numbers  of 
unauthorized  residents  tend  to  have  the  highest  percent  unauthorized.  this  variation 
in  percent  unauthorized  by  country  of  origin  should  have  little  effect  on  estimates  of 
unauthorized residents compiled for most purposes. for example, estimates for each state 
will have a high percentage of unauthorized residents because all of the states have relatively 
large numbers of unauthorized residents from mexico and central america (countries with 
high percentages of unauthorized residents) and relatively few from europe and canada 
(countries with lower percentages of unauthorized residents). 
while clearly a limitation, this statisticabout 89 percent unauthorizedis comparable to 
the percent unauthorized in the residual estimates and in more recent estimates that derive 
legal  status  from acs  microdata.  the  estimates  published  in  recent  years  by  the  pew 
research center, dhs, warren and warren (2013), and capps, et al. (2013) are, strictly 
speaking,  mostly  unauthorized  because  data  are  not  available  for  some  categories  of 
legal residents. that is, some categories of legal or quasi-legal residents, such as recent 
asylees and parolees, aliens who have filed for (but not officially received) lpr status, 
and  recipients  of  temporary  protected  status,  are  included  as  unauthorized  residents  in 
the residual estimates. passel and cohn (2009) noted that their residual estimate of 11.9 
million  unauthorized  residents  in  2008  included  immigrants  from  certain  countries 
holding temporary protected status (tps) or people who have filed for asylum status but 
whose claims are unresolved. this group may account for as much as 10 percent of the 
unauthorized estimate.
