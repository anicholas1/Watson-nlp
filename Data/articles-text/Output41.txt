executive summary
by the end of 2011, the us customs and border protection (cbp) began to 
see a steady rise in the number of unaccompanied alien children (uac) 
from central america, particularly from the northern triangle countries
el salvador, honduras and guatemalaarriving to the us-mexico border. 
the number of children entering the united states from these countries 
more  than  doubled  during  fiscal  year  (fy)  2012  and  continued  to  grow 
through  fy  2014.  in  fy  2013,  cbp  apprehended  over  35,000  children. 
that number almost doubled to 66,127 in fy 2014, with central american 
children  outnumbering  their  mexican  counterparts  for  the  first  time. 
research has identified high levels of violence perpetrated by gangs and 
drug cartels in the northern triangle countries and mexico as a primary 
reason for this surge. under the william wilberforce trafficking victims 
protection reauthorization act (tvpra) passed with bi-partisan support 
in 2008, children from central america cannot be deported immediately 
and must be given a court hearing. 
in  contrast,  unless  there  are  indicia  of  trafficking,  mexican  children 
are  returned  immediately  to  their  country.  advocates  have  expressed 
concern that expedited removal of mexican children places children with 
valid  humanitarian  claims  at  risk  of  being  returned  to  harm,  including 
forcible  recruitment  into  drug  cartels  and  trafficking  rings.  after  the 
spike  in  arrivals  in  fy  2014,  several  members  of  congress  called  for  a 
change in the tvpra, urging that central american children be treated 
like mexican children and undergo expedited procedures for their removal. 
many  of  their  constituents  supported  such  measures.  the  obama 
administration requested additional funds to strengthen border security, 
speed up deportation procedures and implement measures to address the 
humanitarian crisis in central america. groups and individuals across the

introduction:  flight  from  northern  triangle  countries 
and mexico
at the end of 2011, the united states started to experience a dramatic increase in arrivals 
of unaccompanied alien children (uac)2 from central america, particularly from the 
countries  of  el  salvador,  honduras,  and  guatemala  (cbp  2014). the  number  of  uac 
entering the united states from these countries more than doubled in fiscal year (fy) 2012 
and continued through fy 2014 (ibid.).3 the department of health and human services 
office of refugee resettlement (hhs-orr), which provides for the care and custody of 
uac, had a record number of 10,005 children in its care by april 2012 (jones and podkul 
2012). in fy 2013, the us customs and border patrol (cbp) apprehended over 35,000 
unaccompanied children. that number almost doubled to 66,127 in fy 2014, with central 
american children outnumbering mexican children for the first time (cbp 2014). 
various studies, including those commissioned by the united nations high commissioner 
for refugees (unhcr), the womens refugee commission, and the american immigration 
council, have attempted to understand the underlying reasons for the dramatic rise in uac 
arrivals to the united states4 (jones and podkul 2012; unhcr 2014a; kennedy 2014). 
interviews with children have identified high levels of violence perpetrated by gangs and 
drug  cartels  as  a  primary  push  factor  (jones  and  podkul  2012;  kennedy  2014).  other

is under 18 years old; and (3) has no parent or guardian in the united states who can care for him or her. 6 
u.s.c.  279(g)(2).
3   during the first quarter of fy 2015, 10,100 children were apprehended at the southwest border, a 39 
percent decrease compared to the same period in fy 2014. however, analysts suggest that the numbers will 
likely accelerate unless measures to address the root causes of flight are implemented. see meyer et al. 2015. 
4   the united states may not always be the default option. children often try first to relocate within their 
country, and, if they have family in a nearby country, they are likely to seek protection in a country other than 
the united states (kennedy 2014, 4). in fact, unhcr reported a 432 percent increase in asylum applications 
from the neighboring countries of belize, costa rica, nicaragua, panama and mexico by individuals from el 
salvador, honduras, and guatemala (unhcr 2014).

reasons for their flight include extreme poverty, domestic violence, family reunification, 
rumors  of  immigration  benefits,5  and  lack  of  adequate  employment  and  educational 
opportunities.  a  2014  study  conducted  by  fulbright  fellow  elizabeth  kennedy  in 
el salvador found that 90 percent of 322 minors interviewed had family in the united 
states,  but  only  35  percent  provided  family  reunification  as  a  reason  for  attempting  to 
reach the united states (kennedy 2014, 3). most of the children interviewed cited fear of 
crime and violence as the reason for seeking to reunify with family in the united states. 
a study by the us conference of catholic bishops found that over 50 percent of children 
from honduras, guatemala, and el salvador reported that violent crime in their country of 
origin had influenced their decision to leave home (usccb 2012, 7-8). about 50 percent 
of honduran refugees had witnessed gun or gang-related violence, including the murder 
of family or friends (ibid., 8-9). rising levels of gang membership also support the claim 
that  widespread  violence  and  gang  activity  are  an  underlying  cause  of  uac  migration 
to the united states (seelke 2014). additionally, children who reach their teenage years 
start receiving threats and pressure to join gangs, prompting them to undertake a perilous 
journey at a young age with the hope of attaining long-term security. 
this article examines why unaccompanied children have arrived in record numbers to the 
united states in recent years. it provides an overview of the violence that children face in 
el salvador, guatemala, honduras and mexico perpetrated by gangs and other criminal 
organizations.  the  article  discusses  the  us  governments  legal  obligations  towards 
children arriving at its borders and describes good practices of other governments relating 
to the protection of child migrants and refugees. it describes possible forms of relief from 

5   some commentators contend that immigration policies such as deferred action for childhood arrivals 
(daca)  and  rumors  spread  by  smugglers  have  encouraged  the  influx.  however,  recent  entrants  are  not 
eligible for daca and the study conducted by kennedy found that the majority of salvadoran children 
interviewed had never heard rumors to the contrary.

background: children and gangs 

gang culture in the united states 

much  of  the  violence  in  central america  and  flight  of  central americans  north  is  the 
consequence of long-term social inequality and poverty throughout the region. violence 
in the region grew and spread in large part due to us support of wars against popular 
movements seeking social change in northern triangle countries in the 1970s and 1980s. 
the violence and displacement over the past decades are the legacy of these wars with 
consequences not only in central america but in the united states as well.6
the origin of gangs in the united states can be traced as far back as the 1780s. gangs 
emerged with particular force when waves of irish, italian, slavic and other immigrants 
came to the country in the nineteenth century (thale and falkenburger 2006; howell and 
moore 2010). gangs in central american immigrant communities began to develop in los 
angeles by the 1980s, the mara salvatrucha (ms-13) and the 18th street gang being the 
most prominent (thale and falkenburger 2006, 2-4; howell and moore 2010, 9-12, 14; 
seelke 2014). gangs tend to originate in communities characterized by poverty, racism, 
disenfranchisement, deprivation, and low levels of social control and exposure to violent 
conflict increases the risk of affiliation (johnson 2006). 
us politicians mistakenly believed that deportation of gang members would remedy the 
gang  problem  in  the  united  states.  this  led,  in  part,  to  congressional  approval  of  the 
illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996, which significantly 
expanded  the  range  of  criminal  activities  and  convictions  for  which  immigrants  could 
be  deported  (thale  and  falkenburger  2006,  4;  seelke  2014,  2-3).  persons  with  certain 
criminal convictions became subject to deportation regardless of their length of time in the 
united states, family and community ties, or status as lawful permanent residents (lprs) 
(johnson  2006).  deportations  of  thousands  of  central americans  occurred  at  the  same 
time as guatemala and el salvador were ending long-term civil wars and honduras was 
recovering from low-intensity conflict that left more than ten thousand persons disappeared. 
the united states has targeted gang members through programs such as operation return 
to sender implemented in 2006, and the ongoing operation community shield, launched 
in 2005 (thale and falkenburger 2006, 4; seelke 2014, 15). unfortunately, the involuntary 
return of gang members to countries of origin has resulted in strengthening the transnational 
link between the central american and us gangs, without curtailing the level of gang 
violence in central america or in the united states (thale and falkenburger 2006, 4).7

us foreign policy in the region, see understanding central america: global forces, rebellion and change 
by john a. booth, christine j. wade and thomas w. walker (westview press 6th ed., 2014). 
7   see also seelke 2014 stating that policymakers in central america have expressed concerns regarding the 

132

journal on migration and human securitymigration flows have reinforced this link and have contributed to the spread of us gang 
culture throughout central america (arana 2005; thale and falkenburger 2006, 4; howell 
and moore 2010, 15; johnson 2014). 
in  response,  central  american  governments  have  adopted  highly  repressive  policing 
strategies, often referred to as mano dura (iron fist), in order to curtail gang violence and to 
assert control over the increasing rise in gang membership. mano dura laws and policies have 
made youth gang membership unlawful and apply more relaxed evidentiary standards in 
legal proceedings against them, resulting in massive detention of gang members and harsh 
prison sentences (thale and falkenburger 2006, 3, 5). gangs now control many of the 
prisons in el salvador, guatemala, and honduras, operating their criminal activities form 
within prison walls. rather than reducing gang activity, these short-term repressive policies 
have stimulated gangs to go underground, become more organized, commit more violent 
crimes, become involved in new types of criminal conduct, and lower their public profile 
(ibid., 4-5, 11, 20).8 in addition, gangs are often blamed for crimes actually committed 
by other parties, and a large number of young men are being arrested merely for having a 
tattoo or wearing baggy pants (ibid., 3, 5; seelke 2014, 4).

violence in honduras

during the last six years, transnational criminal groups, especially mexican drug cartels, 
have increased their presence in honduras. the 2009 coup that removed president manuel 
zelaya  from  power  exacerbated  the  instability  in  the  country.  shortly  after  the  coup, 
colombian drug traffickers changed their routes and made honduras the primary point 
for cocaine transfer to the mexican cartels (noriega and lanza 2013). local gangs such 
as the 18th street gang and the chirizos have grown in great part due to the presence of 
the colombian and mexican cartels (gurney 2014). the honduran police force is one of 
the most corrupt in the americas. the government often uses the military to enforce the 
law and the judicial system is weak (insight crime 2014). gang violence, propelled by 
drug trafficking and weak law enforcement, has made honduras one of the most violent 
countries in the region (the economist 2013).
as of 2012, the most recent year for which global statistics are available, honduras had the 
highest homicide rate in the world at 90.4 deaths per 100,000 people (undoc 2013). total 
homicides increased from a total of 2,417 in 2005 to a peak of 7,172 homicides in 2012, 
before declining slightly to 6,757 in 2013 (observatorio de la violencia 2006; 2013; 2014). 
the most recent reports released by the honduran government on december 31, 2014, 
report that the homicide rate has decreased to 66 per 100,000 inhabitants from a rate of 79 
per 100,000 in 2013 (gagne 2014; la prensa 2015). san pedro sula and distrito central 
(an area comprising the capital, tegucigalpa), had the first and fourth highest homicide 
adverse effects of us deportation policies on the regions gang and security problems and indicating that us 
law enforcement has compiled evidence that certain imprisoned ms-13 leaders had requisitioned retaliatory 
killings of people in the washington, dc metro area and were attempting to unify salvadoran gang cells with 
their us counterparts. 
8   for example, thale and falkenburger report that gang members now refuse to get tattoos or wear clothing 
that would identify them as gang members, making them less visible for law enforcement identification. 
seelke observes that mano dura techniques proved counter-productive, and falsely-imprisoned youth who 
were not gang members often became so in prison.

humanitarian protection for children fleeing gang-based violencerates  in  the  world  outside  a  war  zone,  at  169.30  per  100,000  and  101.99  per  100,000, 
respectively (ccspjp 2013). 
children and teens have been the primary targets of the significant increase in both inter-
gang and generalized violence (jones and podkul 2012, 9). according to the washington 
office on latin america, honduran boys and men ages 15 to 30 have a one in 300 chance 
of being murdered (jesuits and wola 2014). since 2005, the murder rates for women 
and girls have increased by 346 percent, while murder rates for men and boys increased by 
292 percent (ibid.; observatorio de la violencia 2006; 2013; 2014). in the first five months 
of 2014, over 454 young people under 24 years of age were murdered, with 102 murders 
occurring in may alone. of these recent homicides, 64 percent of victims were 18 to 23 
years old, while 36 percent were under 17 years old (la nacin 2014). 
while the statistics do not indicate which proportion of these deaths resulted from gang 
violence, unhcr found that about 34 percent of honduran children were fleeing to escape 
violence perpetrated by gangs or other criminal groups (unhcr 2014a). selvin, a 23-
year old honduran, fled honduras when he was 16 years old and now lives in worcester, 
massachusetts. he described his experience with gangs as follows: [t]hose guys, they 
make you to do things that you dont want to do. youre trying to be someone in life, but 
you cant, unless you join them selling drugs, killing people. and you didnt want to do 
that. you want to be a better person (malone and gaynor 2012). 
police  and  members  of  the  public  in  honduras  also  engage  in  violence  against  poor 
adolescents, and young men in particular (us department of state 2014c). young people 
who do not belong to a gang and who have not been violently targeted by gangs may fall 
victim to police and civilian violence, particularly if they are supposed habitual criminals 
[or] suspected gang members and sometimes for no apparent reason at all (ibid.). 

violence in el salvador 

el salvadors homicide rate declined from 66 per 100,000 in 2011 to 41.2 per 100,000 in 
2012 as the result of a truce between its two biggest gangs, the 18th street gang and ms-
13. however, it still has the fourth highest homicide rate in the world (jones and podkul 
2012, 10; undoc 2013, 122-33). while the homicide rate dropped in 2012, the rate of 
extortion remained the same, or increased in some areas (villiers negroponte 2013). as 
the truce began to break down, homicides increased by nearly 70 percent in the first half 
of 2014 (mejia giraldo 2014; el espectador 2014). the national police report a total of 
3,912 homicides in 2014an average of thirteen murders a dayrepresenting a 35 percent 
increase from the prior year (el salvador.com 2015).
the  2013  us  department  of  state  human  rights  report  for  el  salvador  notes  that 
prisonersincluding gang membersconduct criminal activities from prison, sometimes 
with  the  assistance  of  prison  guards,  raising  serious  concerns  about  the  governments 
ability to control the violence, which disproportionately targets children, young adults and 
single women (us department of state 2014a). 
according to the womens refugee commission, children are mostly targeted by gang 
members at their schools, leading to one of the lowest school attendance rates in latin 

134

journal on migration and human securityamerica (jones and podkul 2012, 10). women and girls are particular targets of violence, 
and 580 out of 4,000 murders committed in 2010 were classified as femicides, or gender-
based murders (ibid., 11). 
unhcr  noted  with  concern  that  72  percent  of  salvadoran  children  interviewed  had 
traveled to the united states after experiencing severe harm, and 66 percent left specifically 
to avoid violence by gang or criminal groups or because of police incapacity in the face 
of such threats (unhcr 2014, 31). kennedy found that 59 percent of salvadoran boys 
and 61 percent of salvadoran girls identified crime, gang threats, or violence as a reason 
for migrating (kennedy 2014, 1). gang members threatened and beat mario, age 17, for 
instance, when he rebuffed their attempts to recruit him and he reported the threats to the 
police. when the police failed to respond, he fled to the united states with copies of the 
complaints he filed with the police. many of his friends had been murdered or disappeared 
for refusing to join a gang (malone and gaynor 2012). 
children frequently recounted witnessing murders, extortion, and threats to family members. 
unhcr reported that while boys most often feared gang recruitment and retaliation, girls 
feared sexual violence. maritza, age 15, left el salvador after her uncle told her that a gang 
member was planning to hurt her. she stated, in el salvador they take young girls, rape 
them and throw them in plastic bags. after hearing of the threat, maritzas family decided 
that it was safer to send her to the united states to reunite with her mother than for her to 
remain at home (unhcr 2014a, 34).
according to kennedy, children who do not have a gang presence in their neighborhoods 
frequently indicated that they expect one to arrive soon, viewing it as inevitable (kennedy 
2014). children are targeted by gangs and police alike and have few opportunities. carlos, 
a young salvadoran, described the challenges he faced as a young man in el salvador. he 
stated, [i]n el salvador, there is wrongits being young. youre stalked by gangs, the 
authorities beat and follow kids because they dont trust them; they think they are gang 
members. there are no jobs for young people because employers dont trust the kids either 
. . . it is better to be old (jones and podkul 2012).

violence in guatemala

almost twenty years after the end of guatemalas bloody civil war, the country continues 
to  suffer  from  pervasive  violence  committed  by  gang  members  and  supported  by  state 
corruption. guatemala joins el salvador and honduras as a country with one of the highest 
murder rates in the world. guatemalas 2012 homicide rate topped out at 39.9 per 100,000 
people, the fifth highest rate in the world (jones and podkul 2012; the economist 2013). 
guatemala also has one of the highest rates of femicide in the world, along with honduras 
and el salvador (musalo and bookey 2013), and anecdotes of gang-perpetrated rapes and 
femicides abound (see, e.g., unhcr 2014a; jones and podkul 2012; musalo and bookey 
2013). although homicide rates have declined in 2014, unicef has named guatemala as 
the second most dangerous country in the world for children from zero to 19 years of age; 
el salvador placed first (unicef 2014; examiner.com 2014). 
the ms-13 and 18th street gang are guatemalas most prominent street gangs. although 

135

humanitarian protection for children fleeing gang-based violencethey mainly focus on extortion, they are also involved in other major crimes, including 
kidnapping and bank robberies. while estimates vary widely, the united nations office 
on drugs and crime calculated that there were 22,000 members of the ms-13 and 18th 
street gangs in guatemala in september 2012 (undoc 2012). although both gangs are 
transnational in nature, they are not as centralized and organized as the zetas (daughterty 
2015), a violent transnational criminal organization from mexico.
the  zetas  have  established  operations  in  guatemala  for  their  drug  trafficking,  money 
laundering, and contraband networks. their presence dates back to 2008 when they first 
stored narcotics and arms in the northern region of the country. the zetas control over 
local police and the military is growing and they launder their proceeds through private 
businesses and public contracts. the zetas bribe local police and their supervisors, members 
of the judiciary, and prosecutors, to provide information and protection for the maintenance 
and growth of their operations. they also recruit former military personnelespecially 
those from the special forces known as the kaibilesto provide security (insight crime 
2011; sacks 2013). the zetas have been responsible for some of the most horrific violence 
in guatemala, including the 2011 massacre of 28 farmhands of los cocos farm in northern 
guatemala (insight crime 2011). 
children from the urban areas of guatemala are amongst the most vulnerable to the long-
lasting problems of food insecurity, targeting and recruitment by gang members, and the 
rise in the use of force and violence on the part of state militarized security forces (jones 
and podkul 2012, 11). the united nations has criticized guatemala for the militarization 
of its police force, raising concerns of greater violations of human rights in the country 
(gagne 2015). only 20 percent of guatemalan children interviewed by unhcr reported 
fleeing violence in society, including gang violence. however, many stated that they were 
fleeing  domestic  abuse,  extreme  poverty,  and  state-sponsored  violations,  which  make 
children more vulnerable to gang recruitment (unhcr 2014a, 34; us department of state 
2014b, 19). 
canilo,  a  young  guatemalan  who  fled  to  the  united  states  because  of  gang  violence, 
reported that gang members came to the store where he worked and robbed him. he stated, 
[t]hey took me out of the store, and they took the money and they beat me up . . . they were 
following me everywhere (malone and gaynor 2012). 

violence in mexico 

 there are several major drug cartels operating in mexico, including the zetas, the sinaloa 
cartel and the knights templar, all of them involved in drug trafficking, human smuggling, 
extortion, and human trafficking. armed civilian vigilante groups have formed in a number 
of areas across the country to defend their communities against cartels (the telegraph 
2014). 
the war against the cartels launched in 2006 by mexican president felipe caldern has 
resulted in significant violations of human rights (hrw 2014b). it is estimated that more 
than  120,000  mexicans  died  and  27,000  disappeared  between  2007  and  2012  (molloy 
2013).  torture  is  widely  practiced  by  security  forces  to  obtain  information  and  forced 

136

journal on migration and human securityconfessions. the criminal justice system rarely provides justice to the victims of violent 
crimes and human rights violations (hrw 2014b).
criminal groups in mexico often engage children in smuggling activities precisely because 
us authorities deport them back to mexico with little delay (unhcr 2014a, 38). their 
age, poverty, and exposure to violence from criminal groups and cartels make children 
vulnerable  to  trafficking  and  exploitation  (ibid.,  38,  39).  criminal  organizations  force 
children to engage in unlawful and dangerous activities, including smuggling, which 
facilitates the flight of families and children from northern triangle countries who cross 
the us-mexico border to escape gang violence in their home countries (ibid.). 
the zetas also regularly kidnap migrants from northern triangle countries in mexico and 
demand ransom from their family members in the united states. franklin, for instance, 
was 16 years old when he fled honduras and was kidnapped by los zetas in mexico. he 
noted, [t]he zetas are dangerous. they want money, and they want to know if you have 
family in the us who can pay. after five days in captivity, franklin was able to escape and 
eventually reached the united states (malone and gaynor 2012). 

us  legal  obligations  to  children  fleeing  violence  in 
their home countries
as  the  number  of  unaccompanied  minors  has  steadily  risen  over  the  years,  the  us 
government has developed a structure to address the needs of children seeking protection. 
in  2002,  congress  passed  the  homeland  security act  of  2002. the act  eliminated the 
immigration  and  naturalization  service  (ins),  created  the  department  of  homeland 
security (dhs) and transferred all of its immigration benefit and enforcement functions 
to dhss immigration and customs enforcement (ice), cbp, and us citizenship and 
immigration  services  (uscis)  (byrne  and  miller  2012,  6).9  the  act  also  transferred 
responsibility for the care and custody of uac to hhs-orr.10 us law defines uac as 
persons under age 18 who lack lawful immigration status in the united states and have 
no parent or legal guardian who is willing or able to provide them with care and physical 
custody.11

tvpra screening 

the william wilberforce trafficking victims  protection  reauthorization act  (tvpra) 
of  2008  (tvpra)  governs  the  treatment  of  uac  arriving  in  the  united  states.12  the 
tvpra instituted screening procedures for uac that provide different treatment for uac 

9   homeland security act (hsa) of 2002, pub. l. no. 107-296,  471(a), 116 stat. 2135, 2205 (2002). 
10   hsa of 2002,  462(a), 116 stat. at 2202. 
11   6 usc  279(g)(2) (2012). typically, this means that if a parent or legal guardian is not present to provide 
care (or cannot be present within a short period of time) that child is technically considered unaccompanied 
and processed accordingly (quoted in zamora 2014). thus, a child may have relatives in the united states, 
but if they live on the opposite coast and do not have the money to travel, the child will likely be classified

humanitarian protection for children fleeing gang-based violencefrom contiguous countries (i.e., mexico and canada) than for uac from other points of 
origin (seghetti, siskin and wasem 2014).13 while federal immigration law mandates that 
unaccompanied children from non-contiguous countries be admitted and placed into the 
custody of hhs, similarly-situated children from mexico do not have the same rights and 
can be deported within 24 hours of their arrival if they do not have a valid humanitarian 
protection claim. 
cbp must screen all incoming uac (or suspected uac) within 48 hours to determine 
whether they are uac from a contiguous country and, if so, whether they have been victims 
of trafficking or persecution (seghetti, siskin and wasem 2014, 3-5).14 those uac from 
contiguous countries who fear persecution or may have been victims of trafficking must 
be transferred immediately to hhs-orr. uac from contiguous countries who are not 
found to have a credible fear of persecution or to have been trafficked may be allowed to 
withdraw their application for admission to the united states and voluntarily return to their 
country rather than be placed in removal proceedings (ibid.).15 the number of mexican 
children who enter hhs-orr custody is small (graham 2014).
reports have shown that most mexican children do not receive adequate screening at the 
border. unhcr found that despite the us governments legal burden to establish that each 
mexican uac does not have an international protection need during the tvpra screening, 
cbps operational practices reinforce a presumption of an absence of a protection need. 
during field missions to the border, unhcr personnel observed a bias by cbp officers 
which desensitized them to the needs of mexican children (unhcr 2014b).
ice must transfer all uac arriving from non-contiguous countries such as el salvador, 
guatemala,  and  honduras  to  hhs-orr  custody  within  72  hours;  these  children  are 
typically subject to removal proceedings and may begin an application for asylum or other 
immigration relief in the course of those proceedings (seghetti, siskin and wasem 2014, 
3-4, 8).16 
prior  to  the  tvpra,  there  were  many  obstacles  for  uac  who  hoped  to  obtain  legal 
immigration status in the united states, whether through special immigrant juvenile status 
(sijs),17 political asylum, or other means (usccb 2012). sijs applicants often aged out 
of eligibility because uscis had no mandatory processing deadline, and some would-be 
applicants could not even apply because dhs refused to provide its consent, which was 
a pre-requisite. furthermore, successful applicants did not have access to the specialized, 
federally-funded foster care programs that now exist (ibid.). likewise, underage asylum 
applicants did not benefit from a tolling of the one-year bar, and they were required to 
pursue their cases before a federal immigration court instead of through uscis (ibid.). 
enactment  of  the  tvpra  eliminated  many  of  these  barriers  (usccb  2012,  3-5,  8).

15   8 usc  1232(a)(2) (2012). 
16   8 usc  1232(a)(4), (b)(3) (2012). 
17   for those uac who do not qualify for asylum, sijs may be the only immigration relief available. sijs 
allows children who come to the united stateslegally or notto adjust to permanent resident status if they 
have been abused, abandoned, or neglected by at least one parent. sijs may be available to children who are 
unmarried, under 21, and physically present in the united states at the time of filing (uscis 2014a).

138

journal on migration and human securityadditionally, it provided that sijs applicants only had to prove that reunification with one 
parentrather than bothwas not possible due to abuse, neglect, or abandonment, and that 
return to their home country was not in their best interest (ibid., 8).18 unfortunately, because 
of their limited access to this form of protection, mexican minors who are apprehended at 
the border are unable to apply for sijs. 
it is important to note that until the recent influx of unaccompanied children at the border, 
the  tvpra  had  a  history  of  bipartisan  support  dating  back  to  2000,  when  congress 
originally passed the law. the tvpra was reauthorized in december 2008 by congress 
and signed into law by president bush. 
shortly after the surge in arrivals of families and unaccompanied children at the border 
in 2014, president obama requested $ 3.7 billion in emergency supplemental funding to 
respond to their needs.19 in response to the presidents request, several members of congress 
introduced legislation seeking to amend the tvpra in order to be able to apply the same 
standards to central american children that apply to mexican children. these bills included 
provisions to expedite screening and removal of all unaccompanied children arriving at the 
border and to detain children until proceedings were finalized (zamora 2014). 
with the exception of advocacy groups, few in the public or private sectors have suggested 
that mexican children should be provided the same procedural protections at the border 
as their central american counterparts. this is particularly troubling given the length and 
breadth of violence suffered by children in mexico, including gang and cartel violence, 
violations committed by the military and police, domestic abuse and human trafficking. 

apprehension and detention of unaccompanied minors

typically, uac enter the immigration system through apprehension and detention at a port 
of entry by ice, cbp or the us coast guard. less commonly, they may be apprehended 
internally by local, state, or federal authorities (byrne and miller 2012, 9-10). in the latter 
scenario, uac who have entered the juvenile or criminal system can be transferred to 
dhs detention facilities (ibid., 10). after dhs takes uac into its custody, they are then 
transferred to a temporary detention facility. this temporary detention facility is where 
preliminary dhs processing occurs, in which an initial determination of uac status is 
conducted (ibid.). 
if the child is an accompanied minor from a contiguous country (mexico or canada), he or 
she will be removed with his or her parent or guardian unless it is suspected that he or she 
may be a victim of trafficking or fears persecution. if the child is an accompanied minor 
from a non-contiguous country, he or she will be placed in family detention facilities, from 
which dhs will initiate removal proceedings. if older than 18 years of age, he or she will 
be placed in dhs custody, from which point removal proceedings will be initiated.

humanitarian protection for children fleeing gang-based violencedifferent  detention  procedures  apply  for  unaccompanied  children.  if  the  child  is 
unaccompanied,  under  18  years  of  age,  and  mexican  or  canadian,  a  voluntary  return 
process will be initiated by dhs unless the child fears persecution or may be the victim 
of trafficking.20 if the child is from a non-contiguous country, dhs will initiate removal 
proceedings and transfer the child to the custody of hhs-orrs division of unaccompanied 
childrens services (ducs).
orr provides care for children in its custody through a network of private and nonprofit 
entities and governmental juvenile agencies (byrne and miller 2012, 14). services such as 
education, health care, recreational activities, vocational training, mental health services, 
case management, and, if possible, efforts to reunite the child with family, must be provided 
(ibid.; womens refugee commission 2009, 5). 
orr initially places children according to the information provided by ice regarding age, 
gender, country of origin, date and location of apprehension, and medical and psychological 
condition. children are placed in shelter care, staff-secure care, secure care, and transitional 
(short-term) foster care, based on their special needs, criminal record and age (womens 
refugee commission 2009). according to a vera institute of justice report, 80 percent of 
children are transferred to shelter care, four percent to secure care, another four percent to 
staff-secure care, and the rest to short-term care (ibid., 15).
typically,  when  children  are  transferred  to  hhs-orr-affiliated  long-term  foster  care 
programs, they undergo a second screening process to determine their eligibility for any 
form of immigration relief, including sijs, asylum, t non-immigrant visa (t visa), and u 
non-immigrant visa (u visa) (usccb 2012, 3-5). however, a study conducted by the us 
conference of catholic bishops migration and refugee services (usccb/mrs) revealed 
that very few uac who applied for asylum were granted asylum, and none of the uac in 
usccb/mrs custody had successfully applied for a u or t visa (ibid., 12). children had 
much higher success rates with sijs applications (ibid.). 

protection of minors: a global perspective

convention on the rights of the child: providing emergency and 

humanitarian aid to children
as of august 1, 2014, 194 states are parties to the convention on the rights of the child.21 
although the united states signed the convention, it has not ratified it. the united states 
and  somalia  remain  the  only  two  signatories  who  have  not  ratified  this  treaty.22 while 
the  convention  is  not  binding  in  the  united  states,  many  of  its  provisions  have  been

the convention defines a child as every human being below the age of eighteen years 
unless, under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier.24 the convention 
requires that states parties take appropriate measures to ensure that child refugees and children 
seeking refugee status receive protection and assistance from the state.25 furthermore, the 
convention lays out a number of rights related to the treatment of unaccompanied minors 
and victims of violence, including: 

  states parties are obliged to protect children from trafficking, drugs, and exploitation, 

whether economic, sexual, or otherwise.26 

  states  parties  must  undertake  appropriate  measures  to  help  child  victims  heal 
physically and psychologically from any abuse, exploitation, or violence they have 
suffered.27 

  children have a right to health care and an adequate standard of living.28 
  states must provide care and custody when a childs parents or guardians are unable 

or unavailable to do so.29 

best interests of the child standard and us practices 

these obligations conform to one of the conventions foundational concepts: that states 
parties must act in the best interests of the child.30 the best interests of the child standard 
has deep roots in us domestic and international law (carr 2009).31 in instances of abuse 
and neglect, child custody battles, and other lawsuits involving children, courts seek to 
determine the childs best interests when crafting an appropriate legal solution (ibid., 125-
26). 
in immigration law, however, the best interests of the child standard rarely applies. prior 
to 2008, a federal court settlement, known as the flores settlement agreement, served as the 
guideline for treatment of uac and included no requirement relating to the best interests 
of  the  child  (hill  2010,  91-97). the  united  states  added  best  interests  of  the  child 
language to the tvpra in 2008, requiring uac in hhs-orr custody to be promptly 
placed in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child (hill 2010). 32 
however, this standard does not necessarily apply in determining a legal remedy for the

humanitarian protection for children fleeing gang-based violencechild, who may be treated exactly like an adult under us immigration law.33 furthermore, 
us immigration law too often discards this standard for the sake of expediency or other 
priorities (carr 2009, 126; cavendish and cortazar 2011, 46-47). after recent allegations 
that cbp officers have mistreated uac while in custody, cbp has initiated an internal 
investigation,  but  stories  of  substandard  uac  and  family  detention  conditions  abound 
(preston 2014; hennessy-fiske and carcamo 2014). 
despite  progress  in  the  development  of  us  legal  standards  governing  the  treatment  of 
uac, human rights watch has criticized sub-par screening processes: 

under  current  us  policy,  unaccompanied  migrant  children  who  may  be  refugees 
must undergo initial asylum screenings and some trafficking screenings by armed and 
uniformed cbp officers. by contrast, international standards say it is in unaccompanied 
childrens best interests to be assessed in a friendly and safe atmosphere by qualified 
professionals  who  are  trained  in  age  and  gender-sensitive  interviewing  techniques. 
(hrw 2014a) 

unaccompanied children are generally held in shelters or temporary holding facilities by the 
us government upon apprehension. while these facilities are distinct from adult detention 
centers, they are secure. the practice of housing children in detention-like conditions is 
extremely  detrimental  to  their  well-being  given  their  vulnerability  (corlett  et  al.  2012; 
farmer  2013;  plumer  2013).  to  worsen  matters,  the  united  states  does  not  guarantee 
the  right  to  free  legal  representation  for  unaccompanied  children,  despite  international 
community recommendations that children should be provided counsel especially in court 
proceedings (jones and podkul 2012, 26). the united states recognizes the importance 
of  legal  counsel  for  children  in  other  contextsits  own  child  welfare  system  provides 
representation for minors in the court system as a safeguard of a childs interests in the 
outcome of his or her case (ibid.). 

other country practices relating to migrant and refugee 
children
while no one state implements all of the conventions articles perfectly, a number have 
developed practices worth adopting, some of which are detailed below. 

sweden

in  2009,  sweden  was  among  the  states  parties  that  had  strictly  complied  with  the 
conventions  recommendations  and  had  implemented  new  legislation  and  public  laws 
to  enhance  and  protect  the  rights  of  children.  for  example,  2006  legislation  divested 
the swedish migration board of the care and responsibility of uac and transferred that 
responsibility to municipalities, who have more experience in the care and integration of 
children  into  their  communities.34    sweden  also  enacted  anti-discrimination  legislation, 
33   see, e.g., 8 usc  1158 (establishing requirements for asylum, which apply equally to children and 
adults).

doc. crc/c/swe/co/4 (2009), on file with the authors [hereinafter concluding observations: sweden]. 

142

journal on migration and human securitywhich entered into force on january 1, 2009. the legislation included age as a protected 
ground and also prohibited discrimination throughout the education system. furthermore, 
it established the office of the equality ombudsman which is responsible for implementing 
the law.35 
on  a  related  note,  the  swedish  migration  board  is  very  careful  in  its  age  assessment 
procedures  for  incoming  uac.  children  are  interviewed  by  an  official  who  makes  an 
initial determination of age based on a range of factors, not just physical appearance. in 
cases where the immigrants age is uncertain, officials may pursue additional investigation 
or  request  x-rays  to  help  determine  his  or  her  age  (corlett  et  al.  2012,  65).  in  case  of 
continuing doubts, the case will be resolved in favor of the immigrant (ibid.). 
even  after  the  enactment  of  the  anti-discrimination  act  in  sweden,  the  committee 
on  the  rights  of  the  child,  the  treaty  body  which  monitors  the  implementation  of  the 
convention, was concerned that such laws would not eliminate discrimination in practice 
and criticized de facto discrimination against and xenophobia and racist attitudes towards 
children of ethnic minorities, refugee and asylum-seeking children, and children in migrant 
families.36 the committee commended legislation passed in 2008 that provides asylum 
seekers and former asylum seekers a right to health care and medical services similar to 
that of children with legal residency status.37 however, the committee expressed concern 
that undocumented children had access only to urgent medical care. it also noted that large 
numbers of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children disappear from reception centers, even 
after the responsibility for their housing and custody has been transferred to municipalities. 
it also criticized the absence of legislation to appoint a temporary legal guardian within 24 
hours of a uacs arrival.38

belgium

belgium  has  also  implemented  a  number  of  praiseworthy  laws  and  programs  for  the 
humane treatment of arriving uac.39 the international detention coalition has highlighted 
belgiums  guardianship  procedures  and  housing  and  detention  policies  as  worthy  of 
imitation (corlett et al. 2012, 66, 75, 85). 
immigration  authorities  in  belgium  have  no  connection  to  guardianship  services,  the 
entity that appoints guardians for arriving children. ultimately, the guardian ensures the 
childs overall mental and physical wellbeing. this involves finding housing and a lawyer 
for the child and helping him or her to navigate the countrys legal system. it also requires 
developing a relationship of trust as the guardian proceeds to resolve problems and find a 
long-term solution for the child (ibid., 66).

humanitarian protection for children fleeing gang-based violencebelgium offers a variety of housing options for arriving minors, including collective housing 
facilities, individual housing, and autonomous living with guidance from guardians (72). 
belgium also avoids detaining children and families that are required to return to their 
country  of  origin,  instead  lodging  them  in  return  houses,  where  they  generally  have 
access to education and appropriate medical care (85). 

potential  legal  protections  for  minors  in  the  united 
states 
while there exist a number of legal protection options for minors in the united states, 
including t and u visas, for victims of trafficking and other crimes, daca, and relief 
under the violence against women act, this section will focus only on asylum and sijs. 40

i. asylum 

a.  eligibility criteria 

us law establishes baseline requirements for asylum in 8 usc  1158. to qualify, a person 
must meet the definition of a refugee as defined in the statute, must satisfy procedural 
filing  requirements  and  must  not  be  statutorily  barred  from  asylum.41 the  immigration 
and nationality act defines refugee as any person who is outside any country of such 
persons nationalityand who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling 
to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a 
well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a 
particular social group, or political opinion42 us law requires that the protected ground 
(e.g., political opinion, social group) be at least one central reason for the persecution.43 
most gang-based asylum claims rely on the particular social group or political opinion 
categories, although cases have succeeded on religious grounds as well, where applicable.44 
since the issuance of the supreme courts decision in ins v. elias-zacarias,45 courts have 
also put particular emphasis on the nexus language in the definition of refugee, which 
requires persecution on account of one of the enumerated protected categories.46 in other

of his or her political opinion, social group, or other category, and not merely because he or 
she refused to fight with guerillas or join a gang, for example.47 
this poses a challenge in asylum cases, where refusal to join a gang does not, on its own, 
constitute  expression  of  a  political  or  religious  opinion  or  membership  in  a  particular 
social group.48 in fact, [a]djudicators [of gang-based asylum claims] have been quick to 
conclude that gangs are motivated by the desire to increase their ranks, wealth, or power 
rather than by the victims political opinion, religion, or social group membership.49 this 
has been particularly problematic in political opinion and religious persecution cases, since 
persecutors rarely share with their victims the precise reasons for their beating, kidnapping, 
or  torturing  (frydman  and  desai  2012,  15).50  social  group  cases  often  fail  in  the  first 
instance on social visibility and particularity grounds, as discussed below (ibid.). 

b.  gang-related asylum case law
1.  particular social group 

courts  have  uniformly  adopted  the  board  of  immigration appeals  (bia)  formulation 
of particular social group in matter of acosta as one whose members share a common, 
immutable characteristicthat members of the group either cannot change, or should not be 
required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.51 
matter of acosta goes on to specify that [t]he shared characteristic might be an innate 
one such as sex, color, or kinship ties, or in some circumstances it might be a shared past 
experience52 
however, subsequent decisions have altered the acosta formula, creating challenges for 
gang-based asylum seekers. in 2008, the bia decided matter of s-e-g-,53 which officially 
designated social visibility and particularity requirements for social group membership. 
its  companion  case,  matter  of  e-a-g-,54  rejected  the  claimants  two  proposed  social 
groups for failure to meet these new requirements: (1) young salvadorans who have been 
subject to recruitment efforts by criminal gangs, but who have refused to join for personal, 
religious, or moral reasons and (2) family members of such salvadoran youth.55 matter 
of e-a-g- refused social group status to persons resistant to gang membership for lack of 
social visibility56 and rejected the proposed group of young persons who are perceived to 
be affiliated with gangs because association with criminal entitiesand thus the mistaken 
perception that one is involved with such entitiescannot underpin an asylum claim.57

humanitarian protection for children fleeing gang-based violencethe circuit courts have largely adopted the bias social visibility and particularity 
requirements from matter of s-e-g- and matter of e-a-g-, and generally show no sign of 
changing course in the near future. however, the third and seventh circuits have refused 
to defer to these bia requirements, and the ninth circuit seems on course to join them 
(frydman and desai 2012, 3-6).58 perhaps because of this circuit split, the bia decided 
two new cases in 2014 which explicitly attempted to clarifynot overrulethe social 
visibility  requirement,  which  the  bia  renamed  social  distinction.59  in  doing  so,  it 
emphasized  that  social  visibility  had  never  meant  literal  ocular  visibility.60  matter  of

or recognizes persons sharing the particular characteristic to be a group.61 matter of m-e-

not  determinative;  rather,  courts  must  look  to  societys  perception  or  recognition  when 
determining the validity of a given social group.62 the potential repercussions of these 
decisions are not yet known since the circuit courts have not yet had the occasion to address 
this new precedent. 
while gang-based social group claims are often difficult to prove at the bia and circuit 
court  level,  successful  claims  before  immigration  judges  indicate  an  openness  on  their 
part to consider them. for example, in one case, the immigration judge determined that 
the claimants were members of a social group defined by membership in their family and 
the fact that they were identical twin girls.63 despite the fact that the girls had never been 
physically harmed by gang members, the judge found that they had suffered past persecution 
based on the alleged aggressiveness of certain gang members and the fact that the girls 
had changed schools and essentially secluded themselves at home, taking taxis between 
home and school to avoid recruitment, rape, or other misfortune.64 the judge found past 
persecution but also made sure to analyze well-founded fear of future persecution in case 
the government appealed the decision.65
generally, social group cases fall into one of a few categories, some of which have proven 
more successful than others. ultimately, the only category of social group claim that almost 
invariably fails is the claim predicated exclusively on resistance to gang recruitment or

if they succeed, it tends to be at the immigration judge level.67 on the other end of the 
spectrum, claims of persecution based on membership in a particular family are among 
the most successful. courts at all levels recognize the family as sufficiently visible and 
particular,68 so the major challenge with these groups is proving nexus (frydman and desai 
2012,  12-14).  claims  by  former  gang  members  also  tend  to  succeed,  although  current 
gang membersactive or notwill be denied asylum.69 prosecutorial witnesses and police 
informants have met with less success due to the bias decision in in re c-a-,70 which 
denied relief to former noncriminal government informants working against the cali drug 
cartel. however, many circuits have since recognized that police informants constitute a 
particular social group (ibid., 11-12).71 relief will therefore largely depend on the federal 
judicial circuit in which the individual resides (ibid.). gender-based claims can be successful 
as well, particularly at the immigration judge level. however, many of the gender social 
group  claims  are  rejected  as  overly  general,  amorphous,  unparticular,  or  insufficiently 
visible in society.72 for example, a particular social group of women between certain ages

humanitarian protection for children fleeing gang-based violencewithout more characteristics may be taken as too broad and considered a mere demographic 
division. such a group possesses a multiplicity of other characteristics, including lifestyles, 
diverse  cultural  backgrounds  and  religious  affiliations.  in  order  to  bolster  such  claims, 
evidence of other characteristics in addition to gender should be submitted to narrow 
the diverse and disconnected group. 73

2.  political opinion 

as with social group claims, refusal to join a gang for allegedly political reasons does not 
typically qualify a person for asylum. courts almost uniformly deny such cases on two 
grounds: (1) lack of political opinion or imputed political opinion and (2) lack of nexus 
(frydman and desai 2012, 16-18).74 in fact, since matter of s-e-g- and matter of e-a-g-, 
which  addressed  political  opinion  claims  as  well,  no  published  cases  have  found  that 
refusal to join a gang substantiates a political opinion asylum claim.75 in those two cases, 
the bia found no indication that the gangs persecution resulted from respondents political 
or  imputed  political  opinion,  stating  that  it  was  equally  possible  that  the  gangs  merely 
wanted to increase their ranks.76 even in seemingly worthy cases, like rivera barrientos v. 
holder,77 the courts have dismissed indications that political opinion caused persecution, 
concluding instead that recruitment concerns were the gangs primary motivation.78 
rivera barrientos had responded to ms-13 recruitment attempts saying, [n]o, i dont want 
to have anything to do with gangs. i do not believe in what you do, to which they responded 
[i]f you dont want to join with us, if you dont participate with us, if you are against us, 
your family will pay.79 later, ms-13 members gang-raped her, but the circuit court still 
determined that this could have occurred just as much for recruitment purposes as for her 
political opinion.80 under the immigration and nationality act, an applicant for asylum 
must establish that race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or 
political opinion was or will be at least one central reason for the claimed persecution. 
81  concerns  have  been  raised  that  courts  are  misinterpreting  the  one  central  purpose 
language in the statute to mean the central purpose when analyzing nexus in political 
opinion  cases  and,  thereby,  impermissibly  limiting  other  potential  purposes  (frydman 
and desai 2012, 17). courts seem to approve such claims only when the applicant was 
already  a  member  of  a  group  that  the  persecutors  viewed  to  be  a  political  opponent.82

journal on migration and human securityinformant also tend to fail due to lack of nexus because courts attribute greed and a desire 
for retribution as the primary motivators for gang persecution in such cases (ibid., 18-19). 
cases  at  the  immigration  judge  level  seem  to  meet  with  more  success.  for  example, 
applicants have received asylum for imputed political opinion based on family members 
politics83 and for repeated refusal to join a gang.84 in other cases, belief in the rule of law 
and opposition to crime and the criminal lifestyle constituted a political opinion.85 

3. religion 

claims based on religious persecution can be successful, particularly at the immigration 
judge level. when they fail, it is often for lack of nexus.86 in fact, circuit courts that have 
adjudicated  gang-based  religious  persecution  cases  have  not  yet  approved  a  case,  each 
finding lack of a sufficient nexus.87 however, these cases either lacked evidence that gang 
members knew of and cared about the claimants religious views, or they involved a mixed-
motive, and the courts found personal and financial reasons to be the initial and central 
cause of the persecution.88 thus, there is no reason to believe that these claims will continue 
to fail in the circuit courts if the nexus between religious views and persecution can be 
established. in cases in which gang members knew of the claimants religious opinions 
before approaching them, the claim would be better-situated than those which the circuit 
courts have addressed thus far.89

humanitarian protection for children fleeing gang-based violenceto lpr status if they have been abused, abandoned, or neglected by at least one parent.90 
sijs may be available to children who are unmarried, under 21, and physically present in 
the united states at the time of filing (uscis 2014). 
to qualify, a us state juvenile court must designate the uac a dependent on the court and 
declare that the uac cannot reunite with one or both parents due to abuse, abandonment, 
neglect, or similar reasons (uscis 2011). furthermore, the juvenile court must determine 
that  it  is  not  in  the  best  interests  of  the  child  to  be  returned  to  his  or  her  country  of 
citizenship  (ibid.).  after  the  juvenile  court  makes  this  factual  finding,  uscis  can 
adjudicate the immigration application and grant sijs (ibid.). 
although a grant of lpr status to an unaccompanied child is certainly a positive outcome, 
it does not come without a price. the law prevents a child from petitioning for a parent or 
a sibling based on his or her lpr status. in addition, the family court process can place 
a child in the uncomfortable and difficult position of alleging neglect against his or her 
parents who have made the difficult decision of sending their child north on a dangerous 
journey. parents must decide between the dangers at home versus the journey north with 
the hopeful goal of protection for their child in the united states, and children typically 
find no fault in their parents decision. 
the  number  of  applications  for  sijs  has  steadily  risen  over  the  last  years  from  1,645 
in 2010 to 3,993 in 2013 (uscis 2013). these numbers are low in comparison to the 
potentially thousands of eligible children who enter the united states on a yearly basis. 
lack of counsel and the bifurcated nature of sijs proceedings, which involve family courts 
and uscis pose a real challenge in identifying and obtaining sijs for many children. 

conclusion
there are a number of ways in which the us government, nongovernmental organizations 
(ngos), and individuals can work together improve protection of unaccompanied children 
fleeing their countries. local and state bar associations across the united states are working 
with immigration and family lawyers within their ranks to create pro bono programs to 
identify and provide representation to children. immigration courts are working closely with 
ngo advocates and private attorneys to create friend of the court programs, encouraged 
by the executive office for immigration review (eoir), to better adjudicate childrens 
cases.91 
several medical-legal-social partnerships have been created in cities, including new york, 
philadelphia, san francisco, los angeles and in the rio grande valley. a large number 
of children are fleeing their countries of origin because of violence and trauma. while the 
most pressing needs may be medical attention and legal representation for children shortly 
after their arrival, psycho-social support is vital in the long-term for them and for their 
caregivers.

journal on migration and human securityin order to comply with national and international obligations, the obama administration 
and policymakers should focus on the following:

  additional personnel to adjudicate claims: the number of immigration judges 
and uscis asylum officers is insufficient to adequately and fairly process the 
claims for protection filed by children. as a result, backlogs have increased in 
the adjudication of cases in both the courts and before the uscis asylum office. 
there are over 430,000 cases pending on the dockets of 260 immigration judges 
sitting  in  58  immigration  courts  across  the  country.  cases  remain  pending  on 
some court dockets for up to 800 days.92 the number of applications for asylum 
filed in immigration court and with uscis in 2014 rose to 121,200 claims44 
percent more than the number filed the previous year (unhcr 2014c, 3).93 as 
a result of the overload of cases, applicants who file with the uscis asylum 
office can expect long delays as they wait to be interviewed, in some cases from 
one to two years (carlson 2015). resources should be provided to train and hire 
new immigration judges and asylum officers immediately in order to assure that 
due process rights of both the children and those affected by the backlogs are 
protected. long delays adversely affect the asylum process. witnesses may no 
longer be available. memories fade. torture victims suffer greatly when they are 
unable to present their claims in a timely fashion. they are left in a state of limbo, 
which can and often does cause psychological harm. 
incorporating best interests of the child standard into all decision-making, 
not just custody decisions. the bipartisan immigration reform bill passed by 
the senate in 2013, s. 744, would require cbp to give due consideration to 
the  best  interests  of  the  child,  family  unity  and  humanitarian  concerns  in 
repatriation  decisions. amendment  1340  to  that  bill,  which  was  unfortunately 
not  included  in  the  senate  vote,  would  have  made  the  best  interests  standard 
the  primary  consideration  in  all  federal  decisions  involving  unaccompanied 
children. congress should pass s.744 and include the amendment. 

 

  cbp screening: organizations and individuals have raised concerns regarding 
the border patrols ability to fairly screen children from non-contiguous countries 
for trafficking and persecution and to prevent the return of children to persecutors 
or abusers. measures must be taken to improve the screening process. men and 
women in uniform with weapons should not question children. cbp screeners 
should, at minimum, be paired with child welfare experts or ngo personnel, as 
proposed in s. 744. alternatively, cbp screeners should be replaced with uscis 
asylum officers. 

  due  process  protections:  organizations  and  individuals  have  advocated  for 
a  system  which  provides  greater  procedural  protections,  resources,  and  time 
to  protect  families  and  children  under  the  law  without  unduly  delaying  the 
adjudication process. these measures can and should include access to court-
appointed counsel and legal orientation programs. us immigration law has been

humanitarian protection for children fleeing gang-based violencelikened in complexity to us tax law. thus, the need for adequate and free counsel 
along  with  understandable  information  on  the  legal  process  is  vital  to  protect 
children fleeing the violence in their countries. 

efforts to address the problems arising as a result of the violence in the northern triangle 
countries and mexico should not be limited to the united states. mexico, guatemala, el 
salvador, honduras and the united states must share responsibility for addressing the push 
and pull factors of refugee flows northward. a human rights-based approach must form the 
basis for collaboration and should prioritize the following: 94

  promote  sustainable  economic  development:  development  should  focus  on 
job creation, training and education to provide opportunities for young people in 
sending countries.

  sponsor violence prevention programs: funding should be funneled to credible 
and  successful  violence  prevention  programs  in  communities,  to  reintegration 
efforts for young people seeking to leave behind the influence of gangs, and for the 
protection of children who have suffered or are at risk of violence. organizations 
in the united states such as homeboy industries in los angeles, internationally 
recognized as one of the most successful gang intervention and reentry programs of 
its kind, can provide a model for the creation of similar programs in the northern 
triangle countries.95

  strengthen  civilian  institutions:  in  order  to  effectively  confront  and  resolve 
problems of organized crime, gangs and insecurity, the northern triangle countries, 
mexico,  and  the  united  states  should  work  together  to  create  and  support 
professional and accountable police forces and an unbiased and effective criminal 
justice  system.  civilian  institutions,  not  the  military,  should  be  responsible  for 
criminal investigations, prosecutions and sentencing. the united states is urged 
to share its resources and experiences in strengthening institutions to effectively 
enforce laws against organized crime within its borders.  

  combat  corruption  and  increase  accountability:  strong  programs  must  be 
established to increase transparency and accountability to address deep corruption 
which prevents access by individuals to services, weakens state bodies, and poisons 
democracy. 

the united states is urged to support governments and agencies whose leaders demonstrate 
a serious commitment to strengthening civilian-led enforcement, sound prosecutions, and 
the rule of law. sending countries must encourage and create conditions necessary for the 
effective participation of civil society in this process; otherwise, it will fail. 

94   the washington office of latin america published these suggestions after a meeting of vice-president 
joseph biden, the presidents of el salvador, guatemala and honduras and inter-american development 
bank president luis alberto moreno on november 14, 2014, during which they discussed a joint plan to 
respond to the underlying conditions driving migration from central america. more information is available

journal on migration and human securityalthough unexpected numbers of migrants and refugeesespecially vulnerable families 
and childrencertainly pose challenges for the us government, measures consistent with 
us legal and moral obligations must be taken to protect those seeking refuge and safety 
in our nation. we should heed pope francis call that these children be welcomed and 
protected as he stated during his 2014 colloquium on migration in mexico (blumberg 
2014). to do otherwise runs contrary to our identity as a nation.
