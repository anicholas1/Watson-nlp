executive summary
most human capital and migration studies classify migrants with limited 
formal  education  as  unskilled,  despite  substantial  skills  developed 
through  job  and  life  experiences.    drawing  on  a  binational  multi-stage 
research project that involved interviews with 320 mexican migrants and 
return migrants in north carolina and guanajuato, mexico, we identify 
the lifelong human capital they acquired and transferred throughout their 
careers and discover that these include not only basic education and english, 
but also technical and social skills and competences acquired informally on 
and off the job throughout the course of ones life.  we further find that the 
learning and transfer of skills is a lifelong, gendered process, reflecting 
the different social contexts and jobs in which men and women learn. in 
this  paper  we  document  several  mobility  pathways  associated  with  the 
acquisition and transfer of skills across the migratory circuit, including 
reskilling, occupational mobility, job jumping, and entrepreneurship. 
our study has broad implications for the migration policies of both the 
us  and  mexico.  us  immigration  policy  confers  preference  to  skilled 
immigrants who rank high on traditional human capital characteristics, 
such as education levels and other formal credentials, but limits the entry

informal skills they bring to us labor markets.  instead of focusing only 
on the continued expansion of immigration policy preferences for narrowly 
defined  skilled  migrants,  the  us  government  needs  to  consider  more 
carefully  what  we  mean  by  skilled  workers  and  design  fairer  and  more 
effective  immigration  policies  that  match  their  abilities  to  the  specific 
needs  of  us  industry  and  thereby  recognize  the  economic  contributions 
of all migrants within a lifelong human capital framework.  mexico can 
also  learn  from  our  findings.  between  2005  and  2010  an  estimated  1.4 
million  mexicans returned to mexico from the us, a figure roughly double 
the  number  who  had  returned  in  the  five-year  period  a  decade  earlier 
(passel et al. 2012). the government of mexico has a history of developing 
programs to provide for mexicans abroad and encourage their remittances. 
our research indicates that the mexican people and their economy would 
benefit by supporting entrepreneurial ventures and reintegration programs 
that recognize and reward the enhanced skill sets of return migrants. as 
we show, some of these individuals are able to fill valued positions and start 
businesses of their own, creating more jobs in their home communities and 
thus promoting local economic development.

introduction
star and strauss (1999) have described the manner in which the public has viewed low-wage 
workers in the service sector as non-people, despite the value of their work experience and 
interpersonal skills.  the low degree of social recognition of these skills contributes to their 
low status. nowhere is this truer than in the perception of unskilled migrants, especially 
unauthorized immigrants with low levels of formal education.  scholars of migration fall 
into the same trap, regularly classifying migrants into two groupsskilled and unskilled 
based solely on easy-to-measure attributes and certifications. 
the evidence in this paper challenges the narrative of the unskilled migrant by unpacking 
and elucidating what the category of unskilled really covers. drawing on 120 in-depth 
interviews  conducted  in  north  carolina  and  guanajuato  and  a  survey  of  200  returned 
migrants in len, mexico, we identify the total human capital that migrants with low levels 
of education acquire, transfer, and use throughout their migratory careers.  this lifelong 
human capital not only includes easy-to-measure or observable components of traditional 
human capital such as education and on-the-job training, but also technical and social skills 
that are harder to measure and learned away from the classroom, skills that can influence 
mobility pathways. we structure our analysis around three research questions: 
1. what human capital skills do migrants with low levels of education possess, and how 
are these skills acquired? 
2. which job experiences and skills learned in mexico lead to better job opportunities in 
the united states? which skill sets learned in the united states transfer to mexico?
3. how do social and industrial contexts shape how skills are transferred?

identifying and measuring the lifelong human capital of unskilled migrants integrating  migration,  human  capital,  and  learning 
approaches 
our theoretical approach engages two literatures that have had very limited collaboration: 
international  migration  and  human  capital  transfers,  and  learning  and  knowledge 
transactions. the standard human capital model of socioeconomic attainment sees migration 
as an investment in which returns are balanced against costs (sjastaad 1962; harris and 
todaro 1970).  recent immigrants in foreign labor markets generally earn lower wages than 
the native-born because the human capital acquired in countries of origin is undervalued 
or unrecognized in places of destination.  with the acquisition of country-specific human 
capital  such  as  language  proficiency,  education,  and  professional  credentials,  however, 
immigrants  can  achieve  occupational  mobility  and  wage  growth  (chiswick  and  miller 
1986; borjas 1990).  immigrants who do not possess these attributes are often trapped 
and exploited in unregulated industries in the secondary labor market (castells and portes 
1989; zlolinski 1994; flippen 2012). 
human capital theory recognizes that the skills acquired abroad can facilitate economic 
mobility  upon  return    (williams  and  balaz  2005;  dustmann  and weiss  2007).    return 
migrants can benefit economically from the acquisition of formal human capital abroad, 
including  schooling  and  english  language  (dustmann  and  kirchkamp  2002).    return 
migrants experience the most economic gains when their jobs match their us occupations 
(zahniser and greenwood 1998) and are also more likely than non-migrants to engage in 
entrepreneurial activities, but most studies credit this difference to duration abroad, savings, 
and  number  of  foreign  jobs  (dustmann  and  kirchkamp  2002;  mesnard  and  ravallion 
2006), not skills transfers. finally, source countries can gain from the opportunities that its 
emigrants have to acquire skills abroad (dustmann and weiss 2007).
the scholarship on international migration and human capital acquisitions and transfers 
remains incomplete for three reasons.  first, although human capital theory recognizes 
that  human  capital  refers  to  both  an  individuals  stock  of  observable  skills  (schooling, 
post-schooling training, language capital) as well as unobservable skills (pre-labor market 
influences,  innate  abilities),  data  requirements  compel  most  empirical  studies  to  rely 
largely on formal qualifications and credentials as proxies for human capital (chiswick 
1986, borjas 2000, among others).  this practice encourages a dichotomy of skilled and 
unskilled or low-skilled (williams 2006; 2007a). 
in contrast, the scholarship on learning and knowledge transfers recognizes and studies 
many different types of knowledge (williams 2006).  because this literature has focused 
primarily on codifiable knowledge, it theoretically captures the technical (high levels of 
symbolic manipulations) and routine (repetitive work) but ignores what polyani (1966) 
terms tacit knowledge (knowledge that cannot be demonstrated in explicit ways), what 
reich (1992) refers to as social skills (those that facilitate communication) or what evans 
(2002) refers to as competences (communication skills; skills related to values and attitudes, 
such as responsibility and reliability; and practical competences, such as willingness to 
follow through and carry out tasks). 
a second weakness of scholars working in the human capital framework is that they rely 
primarily  on  skills  that  are  learned  in  formal  institutional  settings,  such  as  on-the-job 

78

journal on migration and human securitytraining programs, educational settings, and vocational programs, thus favoring the study 
of  knowledge  acquired  by  highly-educated  migrants  at  the  schooling  and  employment 
stages of their lives. in contrast, there is broad recognition in the learning and knowledge 
literature that all learning is socially situated and therefore shaped by work and culture 
(blackler 2002) and, as beckett (2000) points out and we document, learning is a lifelong 
process that is not bound by employment. 
a  third  omission  of  human  capital  scholars  is  that  they  have  focused  primarily  on  the 
acquisition of formal human capital in the host country, neglecting the learning and transfer 
of skills beyond education from the home country (but see akresh 2006; hernndez len 
2004; hagan, lowe, and quingla 2011).  by not accounting for source country on- and off-
the-job human capital investments, researchers ignore the value of home country skills for 
learning new ones and the role that skill transfers potentially play in the learning and work 
experiences of immigrants and return migrants.  
we argue that the skills acquired and gains made by mexican migrants have to be understood 
in the context of lifelong human capital. like the creating capabilities approach of human 
development  (nussbaum  2011),  lifelong  human  capital  focuses  on  the  capabilities  of 
individuals that cannot be limited to standardized metrics. migrants with low levels of 
education often develop new skills informally through interaction and observation on and 
off the job that include the transfer of knowledge, tacit skills, and technical know-how that 
cannot be expressed or measured in explicit terms (polanyi 1966; waldinger and lichter 
2003). skill development is also a gendered process: the social contexts in which men and 
women learn and work are different. rather than viewing skill acquisition as stage-specific, 
we conceptualize the accumulation of human capital skills as a lifelong social process that 
is embedded in social networks, families, communities, and labor markets at both ends of 
the migratory stream.  international migration provides the opportunity to learn and apply 
these lifelong skills.
this  broader  perspective  on  human  capital  has  implications  for  how  we  define  and 
measure skills and also how we think about economic mobility, which is usually measured 
through wage increases or occupational change using cross-sectional data at one stage of 
the migration circuit.  we argue that skill acquisition should be considered as a mobility 
pathway in and of itself.  as we demonstrate, skills acquired at one stage of the migratory 
cycle can create individual labor market opportunities at another stage. we identify several 
mobility pathways associated with learning and transferring skills across the migratory 
circuit, including skill upgrading, job transitions, and entrepreneurship.

research design, study sites, and survey sample
this  five-year  research  project  included  two  stages  of  exploratory  fieldwork  followed 
by a survey of a representative sample of return migrants in the industrial city of len, 
guanajuato.2  in stage one (2007-08), we focused on skill acquisition and transferability

representative survey of return migrants to examine the formulation of human capital across the us-mexico 
migratory  circuit  (hagan,  hernndez  len,  and  demonsant  forthcoming  2015,  university  of  california 
press).

identifying and measuring the lifelong human capital of unskilled migrants among  immigrants  working  in  the  construction  and  building  trades  in  north  carolina, 
interviewing 50 migrant workers. in stage two (2009), we traveled to guanajuato, mexico 
and  interviewed  70  return  female  and  male  migrants  working  in  different  occupations, 
industries, and communities. in stage three (2010), we drew on our qualitative findings 
and developed a survey instrument that captures skill acquisitions across the usmexico 
migratory  circuit,  detailing  work  experiences,  learning  techniques,  and  skill  transfers 
before migration, while abroad, and upon return. we selected len, a city of 1.3 million 
inhabitants known as the leather and shoe capital of mexico, as the survey site because of 
its diverse industrial base to capture a range of total human capital and to explore various 
opportunities for economic mobility. 
because  the  mexican  census  includes  a  question  on  whether  any  current  household 
members were living abroad five years ago, we could identify return migrants at the block 
level in len. we drew a random sample of the blocks where return migrants were identified 
in the census, and in summer 2010, a team of six mexican undergraduate students visited a 
total of 77 blocks to obtain a sample of 200 return migrants.3 the 200 interviews averaged 
an hour-and-a-half and included closed- and open-ended questions that captured detailed 
job and migration histories.  beginning with the three-digit codes provided by the mexican 
census, we developed more detailed occupational and self-employment codes, depending 
on skill level and number of job tasks. finally, we developed skill level codes for each 
occupation (table 1).  the data in this paper are from the len survey of 200 respondents. 

sample profile and context of departure and return   

table 2 profiles the len return migrants. most return migrants in the sample are men, 
which is consistent with other studies of return migration that find mexican women are 
more likely than men to stay longer or settle permanently in the us, often migrating for 
purposes of joining a spouse or another family member (ruiz-tagle and wong 2009).  as 
table 2 shows, the return migrants in the len sample possess low levels of traditional 
human capital based on years of formal education, a finding that is consistent with the 
standard literature that reports return migrants have lower levels of education than mexicans 
who stay in the us (ruiz-tagle and wong 2009). despite their relatively low levels of 
education, the len returnees have considerable total human capital as measured by work 
experience, having entered the labor force an average of 22 years ago. ninety percent of 
the sample originated from len. 
table 3 lists the primary reasons for the first migration to the united states and for the 
return to mexico for the last trip.  as predicted by neoclassical economic theory, economic 
factors rank high among respondents reasons. compared to men, women more often cited 
social reasons for migrating, including joining a family member, usually a spouse, a reason 
that  the  literature  reflects  (donato  1993;  hondagneu-sotelo  1994). yet  close  to  half  of 
the women cited economic reasons behind their migration. in recent decades economic 
restructuring and the subsequent rise of female-intensive industries in the us has pulled 
an increasing number of women from guanajuato to the us labor market (arias and pea   
3  although we did survey a sample of 200 non-migrants in len, the purpose of this paper is to examine 
the labor market experiences of individuals before and after migration. in a paper in progress, we conduct a 
comparative analysis of the labor market pathways of return migrants and non-migrants.

2004). aspirations for self-improvement and adventure also weighed in the decision to 
migrate; more than a quarter of the len sample cited adventure, curiosity, interest, and 
opportunities to improve skills. 
return migration is a relatively recent phenomenon, with 76 percent of our sample coming 
home after 2001.  fifty-eight percent of the sample returned to mexico between 2006 and 
2010 in the wake of the great recession and during a period of modest growth in mexico.  
as table 3 highlights, 10 percent reported that economic concerns in the us drove their 
return to mexico. eleven percent of the sample were deported after 1996, a year that marks 
the passage of a number of laws that made it easier to detain and deport migrants (hagan, 
eschbach, and rodriguez 2008). while the anti-immigrant sentiment and poor economic 
conditions in the us pushed some migrants to return to mexico, the positive pull factors 
associated with  going  home  had  more  influence in  return  migration decisions,  findings 
consistent with the historical evidence on return migration (king 2000). over half cited 
family as the primary motive behind return, meaning they wanted to rejoin family or 
kin. a final category that reflects the desire to return home and supports the target income 
theory is completed goals (massey et al. 1993).

social contexts of learning skills in communities of origin 

table 4 features the contexts in which surveyed return migrants acquired their skills and 
knowledge before migrating to the us.  formal learning captures skills and knowledge 
acquired  through  a  structured  set  of  learning  experiences  leading  to  credentials  or 
qualifications that are recognized beyond the workplace or local industry (misko 2008), and 
are thus more easily transferable across local, regional, and national labor markets. skills 
acquired in non-formal social contexts refer to those developed by workplaces for purposes 
of  skill  development,  such  as  on-the-job  training  programs  or  formal  demonstrations 
by  experienced  co-workers  (misko  2008).  because  non-formal  learning  processes  are 
developed at workplaces, they usually do not lead to formal qualification or recognition 
beyond the workplace.  informal learning is unstructured and refers to the acquisition of 
knowledge that is acquired through everyday work and life.  informal learning is very 
much  a  social  process.    skills  and  knowledge  are  acquired  through  interacting  with, 
speaking or listening to or observing more skilled or experienced individuals. the transfer 
of skills and knowledge acquired in the informal learning context depends on an individual 
demonstrating skills and an employer recognizing them. 
as table 4 shows, many in the survey sample combined multiple forms of learning, though 
on- and off-the-job informal learning dominates.  only eight percent used skills acquired 
through formal schooling in their jobs, which is not surprising given that the average number 
of years of schooling in the sample is seven.  of these, however, over half identified either

to  their  jobs  in  construction  and  manufacturing.  the  acquisition  of  mathematical  and 
english language skills during the formative years of schooling has important implications 
in terms of how we conceptualize and measure skills among the  unskilled.  traditionally, 
scholarship identifies migrants with only primary levels of education as unskilled.  yet 
even a few years of formal education  can be important in the acquisition and application 
of certain technical and language skills.

over a third of the sample acquired skills through the non-formal learning environment at 
work.  on-the-job training programs were reported as either offered or required in several 
industries:  nursing,  banking,  real  estate,  pharmacies,  and  international  automotive  and 
agricultural  companies  with  branches  in  mexico,  sometimes  leading  to  inter-company 
transfers across borders.  by far the most often-reported social contexts of learning were 
informally on-the-job through observation, interaction with family and friends, trial and 
error, practice, and off-the-job in homes and communities.  on- and off-the-job learning 
were important for almost all of the jobs migrants held before migrating, but especially 
for those in farming or jobs associated with crafts such as shoemaking, construction, and 
brick-making,  work  environments  that  depend  on  learning-by-doing  rather  than  formal 
education.  take the case of cristin who was introduced to the craft of shoemaking as a 
young boy in his fathers piquita. i would come home from school and watch my father 
make  shoes.    eventually  he  let  me  practice  stitching  the  leather  with  the  pespuntador 
machine recalled cristin.  when cristin entered lens paid labor force at the age of 17, 
he had already acquired considerable cobbling and machinist skills, all of which he learned 
informally through observation and practice at home and in his fathers piquita. 
off-the-job informal learning is also associated with the acquisition of particular skills, 
including construction-related skills such as brickmaking and tile installationskills that 
many  working-class  people  acquire  because  they  lack  the  financial  means  to  purchase 

84

journal on migration and human securitythose products. for example, while he was still in school, ruy assisted his family in the 
construction of a brick addition to their family home.  from my brothers, who had worked 
in construction, i learned to make red bricks, beginning with molding them from mud, 
horse and donkey manure, twigs, and straw, drying them in the hot sun and then firing them 
in an oven fueled by plastics until they turned red.  ruy learned these marketable skills 
from his brothers before entering paid employment. 
women also acquired most of their skills through informal learning, and the types of skills 
were largely influenced by their gendered work experiences and social contexts. because 
the majority of women in our survey were concentrated in domestic service, retail, and 
administrative support positions, jobs that involve face-to-face interactions, they were more 
likely than men to discuss not only the technical skills they acquired in their jobs, including 
cooking, cleaning, and caregiving, but also social competences, such as team work and 
intergroup communication skills. their jobs as receptionists, secretaries, domestics, and 
cooks made them good candidates for similar positions in the us.

skills and job transitions before migration 

as  the  cases  of  ruy  and  cristin  show,  social  contexts  and  processes  through  which 
migrants acquire their skills can facilitate opportunities in local labor markets. table 5, 
which lists the industry transitions from first to last job before migration, shows that over 
a quarter of the sample found their first jobs in the shoe, leather, and textile manufacturing 
sectors of len. many of these first-time skilled and semi-skilled jobholders brought with 
them skills they had learned off-the-job in informal contexts and from an early age, as did 
cristin from his fathers piquita.  
table 5 also shows that about half had just one job before migration, while the reminder 
had two jobs or more.  over 70 percent of the first jobs before leaving mexico were in 
shoe, leather and textile manufacturing; retail and hospitality; and other services, and most 
job changes took place within the same industry. in contrast, persons initially working 
in  construction  and  manufacturing  transitioned  to  different  manufacturing  and  services 
industries.  half the men who found their first jobs in agriculture stayed in agriculture, 
but among those who left, almost three-fourths found jobs in the manufacturing sector 
as  cobblers  and  in  construction  as  plumbers  and  metalworkers.  these  transitions  were 
in  part  facilitated  by  the  acquisition  of  off-the-job  skills  acquired  in  the  social  spheres 
of  household  and  community  before  paid  employment.   three  of  the  four  respondents 
who moved from agriculture to manufacturing and construction reported that the skills 
they acquired off the job at home had enabled their transition across industries and into 
new jobs. off-the-job learning allowed some to transition out of farming and land a paid 
job  in  mexicos  construction  industry,  a  much  desired  occupation  among  the  migrants 
we  interviewed  because  it  offers  a  moderately  better  salary,  involves  learning  multiple 
skills that can be easily transferred to other industries, and requires no formal educational 
credentials.  as table 5 also shows, there was very little movement from the more desirable 
manufacturing  sector  where  workers  held  jobs  as  machinists,  semi-skilled  and  skilled 
shoemakers, welders, auto mechanics, electricians, and plumbers. 
women,  in  contrast,  were  concentrated  in  the  service,  retail,  and  hospitality  industries

overwhelmingly transferred off-the-job skills to paid employment.  all women who worked 
as domestics or cooks reported applying the cooking and cleaning skills they had acquired 
in their own kitchens and homes to their workplaces.  but by and large, their off-the-job 
and on-the-job skills did not provide for substantial occupational mobility, either within or 
across industries, reflecting the narrower occupational opportunities for women relative to 
men (arias and pea 2004).

migrants acquired their skills in a learning context in which home and work are not easily 
distinguishable,  and  interaction  with  family  and  observation  and  experimentation  best 
describe their learning processes.  once in the labor market, they picked up additional 
on-the-job skills through observation and practice and through informal training. the next 
question to address, then, is whether they were able to transfer these skills to their jobs in 
the us.

table 6 shows the skills that return migrants acquired and transferred from all jobs over 
the entire course of the migratory circuit. as predicted by human capital models, most

journal on migration and human securitymexican migrants bring very little traditional human capital with them to their us jobs 
as measured through host country language facility, formal education, vocational classes, 
and on-the-job training programs; in our sample these composed two percent of the entire 
sample. yet,  as table  6  shows,  close  to  half  of  these  migrants  arrived  with  substantial 
skills  and  were  able  to  transfer  them  to  the  us  labor  market.  men  were  almost  twice 
as  likely  as  women  to  report  that  they  transferred  on-the-job  skills  and  three  times  as 
likely to report having transferred off-the-job skills, reflecting their greater occupational 
diversity in mexico and the strong emphasis on off-the-job learning among young boys 
and  men.    machinist  and  electrical  skills,  masonry,  tile  installation,  agricultural  skills, 
and  metalworking  transferred  the  most  common  technical  skills  to  the  us.  because  of 
the limited occupational opportunities for women relative to men, the on- and off-the-job 
skills that women reported centered on interpersonal skills such as caregiving and food and 
beverage preparation, indicative of womens domestic roles as spouses and homemakers, 
and entry-level jobs in food production.

mexico-us skill transfers and job transitions  

do  these  skill  transfers  make  a  difference  in  the  labor  market  experiences  of  mexican 
migrants? do they enable reskilling, job advancement and higher wages? our data suggest 
that  they  do,  but  with  a  caveat.  skills  alone  do  not  assure  economic  mobility.  social 
networks, the conditions and social organization of work environments, and the institutional 
mechanisms that support skill acquisition filter the application of migrant human capital. 
when  they  arrived  in  the  us  most  of  the  migrants  surveyed  found  low-wage  jobs  in 
agriculture,  manufacturing,  retail,  hospitality,  and  other  service  industries  where  they 
labored as farm workers, janitors, busboys, and domestic workers.  these preliminary jobs 
are not surprising, and the scholarship on the labor market incorporation of unauthorized 
migrants with low levels of education and language skills would predict them. yet, almost 
half the sample landed skilled, semi-skilled, or unskilled manufacturing jobs upon arrival 
in the us, indicating substantial skill variation.  thus, some entered entry-level jobs as 
dishwashers and helpers, while others entered those same industries as cooks and skilled 
masons. 

87

identifying and measuring the lifelong human capital of unskilled migrants although social networks play a large role in channeling migrants to their first jobs and 
industries, job transitions can be in part explained by the skill sets they bring with them 
from mexico and in part by the skills they learn on their jobs in the us, which they then use 
to leverage better jobs. of the 20 migrants who entered agricultural work upon arrival, 16 
reported that the agricultural experience in mexico helped them in their agricultural jobs in 
the us.  among the skilled and semi-skilled workers, 40 percent reported applying skills 
learned in mexico to their jobs in the us, and 76 percent got their first jobs because family 
and friends recommended them to an employer. some respondents were recommended 
because of their particular skill sets.  
table 7, which summarizes some social mobility experiences within the sample, shows that 
migrants reskilled in the us and experienced occupational advancement, and wage gains. 
eighty-one percent of the sample learned new skills in the us, and many learned multiple 
skills; 68 percent acquired them through observation on the job, and another 56 percent 
through explicit instruction from a co-worker. reskilling was especially pronounced in 
construction because of the technological differences between the industry in the us and 
mexico.  subcontracting  and  the  social  organization  of  the  work  process  also  facilitate 
reskilling  in  the  construction  industry.    although  subcontracting  generally  makes  for 
precarious  employment  and  working  conditions,  especially  for  unauthorized  migrants 
who often experience wage theft from their subcontractors (bernhardt et al. 2009), this 
system also offers reskilling opportunities to immigrants.  because immigrant construction 
workers  are  also  typically  excluded from  formal apprenticeship and  training programs, 
they depend on learning through observation and trial and error and through informal on-
the-job mentoring from a more seasoned worker or a skilled maestro or encargado  (hagan 
et al. 2011).

reskilling in the us labor market facilitated transitions to jobs that required higher skills. 
as table 7 shows, 36 percent transitioned to better jobs requiring additional skills.  for 
example, the six migrants who moved from one job to another within the agricultural sector 
reported that the on-the-job skills they learned in their us jobs facilitated these moves. 
one reported learning new planting techniques through observation and practice; another 
three were taught how to operate farm machinery through instruction from co-workers 

88

journal on migration and human securityor  supervisors. two  moved  into  foreman  positions,  and  one  migrant,  jaime,  mobilized 
old skills learned off the job at home to engage in what migrant workers call brincando  
(job jumping with skills), first within the agricultural sector, and later across industries 
to construction. recognized as an effective strategy employed by both native-born and 
immigrant  professionals  to  circumvent  exploitation  and  market  new  skills  to  secure 
higher wages (saxenian 1996; shih 2006), the concept of job jumping has not really been 
investigated in studies of labor market incorporation of less educated and unauthorized 
immigrants (but see hagan et al. 2011). we found that migrants with skills regularly took 
the risk and jumped jobs.  among the survey sample, of those that reported changing jobs, 
20 percent reported going out on their own and approaching another employer; among 
these, 59 percent reported changing their jobs to improve wages. others changed jobs to 
leave exploitative work conditions and improve wages, but these transitions required skills. 
there was little movement out of manufacturing, construction, and auto repair, especially 
among the migrants who worked as skilled or semi-skilled masons, carpenters, plumbers, 
electricians, auto mechanics, and machine operators. industries such as construction and 
auto repair offer desirable jobs not only because they provide higher wages and greater 
mobility compared to other migrant-heavy industries like food and hospitality services, but 
also because migrants can apply skills learned at home and learn new ones abroad. 
the us labor market experience for women in the sample was very different. migrant women 
tend to enter a smaller range of jobs in the us compared to their male counterparts (pedraza 
1991).  concentrated in the service and hospitality industries, they work in low-wage and 
undervalued jobs as domestics, janitors, and entry-level food service workersjobs that 
offer few avenues for mobility (pedraza 1991; powers and seltzer 1998; hochschild 2002; 
hondagenu-sotelo 2001; hagan 1998). the migrant women in our study followed this 
pattern: in the us they were concentrated in manufacturing, hospitality, and other personal 
and support services and sales sectors of the economy.   in these sectors they worked as 
private household domestic workers, chambermaids, janitors, or food preparation workers. 
and although the majority reported learning new skills in their us jobs (68 percent), their 
old and new skill sets provided limited opportunities for changing jobs as the nature of the 
particular job shaped opportunity structures for these women.  for example, none of the 
women were able to transition from domestic work, where the isolation and nature of the 
social relations are limited to unequal personal exchanges with employers, making it very 
difficult to advance to other types of jobs (hagan 1998; hondagneu-sotelo 2001). 
those women working in food manufacturing or hospitality reported transferring cooking 
skills  learned  on  and  off  the  job  in  mexico  to  their  us  jobs.    unlike  the  domestics, 
however, some workers in the hospitality industry were able to move to better jobs within 
the industry, from chambermaids, food prep workers, or janitors upon arrival in the us 
to positions as waiters, assistant cooks in restaurants, or supervisory cleaning positions 
in hotels.  in these positions they reported wage increases and more autonomy. they also 
transferred and acquired new on-the-job skills, including preparing and cooking different 
types of food and developing customer service, teamwork, and english skills.  take the 
case of carmen, who upon arrival in the us, found work busing tables at an anglo-owned 
restaurant earning $5.50 an hour.  she spoke no english, but eager to learn, she practiced 
with co-workers and watched television in english.  within time, carmen was promoted 

89

identifying and measuring the lifelong human capital of unskilled migrants to a food preparation assistant.  carmen pointed out to the cook that he was using the 
wrong chiles for chile rellenos. impressed by her initiative he asked her to teach him how 
to prepare the dish the mexican way.  by the time she left the restaurant to return home 
to be with family, she was earning $12.00 per hour, was one of two lead cooks, and spoke 
enough english to communicate with co-workers. 
not all migrants were able to transfer skills from mexico to the us.  in some cases, industrial 
location, regional opportunity structures, and social networks drew them to other sectors 
of the economy. in other cases, their skill sets did not match the skills demanded in the us 
labor market or a lack of english language ability made it more difficult to demonstrate 
skills. lack of work authorization may also impose institutional barriers that block mobility 
and rewards, even when skills are recognized. thus, for migrants to benefit economically 
from the skills they bring with them from their home communities, their skills must not 
only match demands for those skills upon arrival, but workers must be able to demonstrate 
their skills and employers must recognize and value them (williams and bal 2005).  in 
spite of these barriers, as table 7 shows, 65 percent of the sample reported that when they 
were able to demonstrate their skills or when their employers recognized them, they were 
sometimes rewarded, either through higher wages (52 percent), more job responsibility 
(17 percent), and/or more autonomy (19 percent). the skills that employers recognized 
and  valorized  included  both  technical  and  hard  skills,  along  with  what  polyani  (1966) 
refers to as tacit knowledge, and sociologists of migration and labor have call working 
knowledge, competences, social skills, and also soft or people skills (kusterer 1978; 
waldinger and  lichter 2003;  moss  and tilly  1996;  evans  2002;  donato  and  bankston 
2008).  in the immigration and labor scholarship soft skills are regularly associated with 
what an employer wants from her or his workers, and scholars view them as indicative 
of the exploitive nature of immigrant work conditions.  along these lines, and as other 
studies  have  documented,  our  employers  regularly  spoke  of  the  hard  work  ethic  and 
punctuality of immigrants workers. 

us-mexico skill transfers and job transitions 

as table 6 shows, the skill sets that migrants take back to their jobs in mexico are more 
diverse than those transferred to the us.  eleven percent transferred english language skills 
to their current jobs, primarily in the business and tourist sectors of the local economy. 
women were almost twice as likely as men to report transferring english skills, reflecting 
the types of jobs they held in the us (domestic workers, assistant cooks, cooks, waiters, 
sales  clerks),  which  require  regular  interaction  with  english-speaking  managers  and 
customers.  the table shows that while neither men nor women acquired off-the-job skills 
in the us, both transferred substantial on-the-job technical skills to mexico. men reported 
the transfer of construction, carpentry, and automotive repair skills; women reported food 
and beverage preparation skills and some support and managerial skills such as computer 
and data entry knowledge. 
the  most  striking  feature  of  table  6  is  the  substantial  number  of  personal  and  social 
competences that were transferred. migrants listed hard-to-measure personal achievements 
and  competences  such  as  initiative,  responsibility,  self-confidence,  follow-through, 
punctuality,  and  presentation  of  self,  along  with  a  number  of  social  skills,  including 

90

journal on migration and human securitycustomer service, teamwork, and management skills. women were almost twice as likely 
as men to report transferring these social skills, reflecting in part the greater propensity 
among women to hold service jobs in the us, which often require the further development 
of interpersonal skills. 
do these skill transfers make a difference in the types of jobs and labor market mobility 
migrants encounter in the mexican labor market?  our findings are mixed. reintegration 
into the mexican labor market is a complicated process.  skill transfers depend on many 
factors,  including  migration  duration,  whether  the  return  was  forced  or  voluntary,  job 
content, and the industrial sector in which the migrant worked in the us.   there are also 
institutional and social barriers to reintegration in the local labor market, including different 
levels of technological development and the fact that recognition of skills is gendered.

despite  these  reintegration  barriers,  table  8  shows  that  skills  acquired  in  the  us  and 
transferred upon return to mexico facilitated transitions from manual jobs in agriculture 
and manufacturing to service-based occupations in the hospitality and retail industries. new 
skills and remitted savings allowed other former machinists in leather and shoe factories 

91

identifying and measuring the lifelong human capital of unskilled migrants to  bypass  salaried  work  and  open  up  their  own  small-  to  medium-sized  shoemaking 
factories.  others chose not to reenter manufacturing and instead found work in the retail 
and hospitality and service sectors where they also applied skills learned in the us.  of 
those  who  returned  to  len  with  english  language  skills,  some  moved  into  retail  and 
hospitality jobs while others used their english in their professional relationships with the 
international business clientele who travel to len to purchase leather goods. those who 
used their english to find work in hospitality and tourism were waiters or receptionists 
or started their own businesses that cater to english-speaking persons. english language 
capability has enabled some female return migrants to bypass traditional domestic service 
and find work as english teachers or move to tourist towns where they can demand a higher 
salary because of their language skills. 
table 9, which compares the employment status of our sample with the len population, 
highlights the large number of return migrants who started businesses after returning to 
mexico, a finding that has been replicated in other recent studies of return migration to 
mexico (hazan 2013).  we found that launching a business upon return home may be 
more than just a function of applying remitted savings or a strategy to secure higher wages 
and overcome local labor market failures and constraints, as documented in the literature 
(dusstmann and kirchkamp 2002; papail 2002; mesnard and ravallion 2006; cerase 1974; 
gmelch 1980).  it is also an opportunity to apply new technical, personal, and social skills 
learned abroad to an entrepreneurial venture that provides individual occupational mobility 
and opens up possibilities for local development.

in table  9,  we  also  distinguish  between  two  groups  of  return  migrants  who  own  their 
businesses:  those  that  are  self-employed  and  those  that  are  self-employed  and  have 
employees, the latter of whom are identified in the table as patrones. in the former category 
are return migrants who reported using remittances to open up small informal businesses 
(e.g., small sundry shops, ambulatory food and beverage vending stands, and second-hand 
clothing stores) as a survival strategy to overcome barriers to labor market reintegration.  
deportees were largely concentrated in this category, reflecting the problems of labor market 

92

journal on migration and human securityintegration for migrants who are forcibly repatriated and return with little or no financial 
resources and often are stigmatized upon arrival home.  women also were concentrated in 
this category and reported turning to self-employment as a response to the gender and age 
discrimination they experienced in the mainstream labor market.
on the other hand, 14 percent (15 single job holders and 12 job changers) of the migrants 
did become patrones, a figure over five times the patrn percentage for the city of len.  
many of the patrones were target migrants, that is, they moved to the us with the aim 
of accumulating enough capital to open up a business upon return.  they identified two 
factors  that  facilitated  their  entrepreneurial  activities:  remittances  and  skill  transfers.  
eighty percent of all patrones used remitted savings to start their businesses and 68 percent 
applied skills learned in the us to their current businesses.  of these, 64 percent reported 
transferring technical skills acquired in us jobs, including from restaurant and construction 
work, auto repair, and carpentry. 
but  technical  skills  are  not  the  only  skills  that  facilitate  entrepreneurial  activities  and 
diversify local economies.  equally important are the language and social skills successful 
return migrants bring back with them.  fifty-four percent of the patrones and 76 percent 
of  the  self-employed  return  migrants  cited  specific  non-technical  on-the-job  skills  that 
they acquired in the us and were able to apply to their business ventures.  another 35 
percent reported transferring english skills to their entrepreneurial ventures.  take the case 
of enrique, the son of a cobbler, who emigrated from len to the us as a teenager.  after 
graduating from a us high school, he found work in an anglo-owned and -run mexican 
restaurant.  because of his english skills, he quickly moved up the ladder from busboy to 
assistant manager.  when he returned to len, enrique bypassed shoemaking and became a 
self-employed taxi driver, catering to the international english-speaking business clientele 
who travel to len to purchase leather goods. his services are unique, providing airport 
transfers, tours of the city, and chauffer service for the day. when asked about the skills he 
learned in the us, he referred to a set of integrated personal and social competences that 
he had learned from his boss in the restaurant: confidence, responsibility, initiative, and 
customer service. 

assessing welfare gains across the migratory circuit
to assess migrants cumulative and relative welfare gains across the migratory circuit, we 
now turn to table 10, which provides subjective and objective measures of well-being and 
social mobility across the labor market careers of return migrants. although the majority of 
the sample reported considerable job satisfaction in their labor market careers, the percentage 
reporting job satisfaction was highest in the us. even though their limited english and 
unauthorized status placed many migrants in exploitative work conditions, we know from 
qualitative interviews that migrants gained satisfaction from, among other things, higher 
wages, opportunities for learning new skills, and rewards for skill recognition. 
transitioned to a higher skilled job reflects a direct measure of occupational mobility 
associated with skill transfers. it is in our opinion the most direct evidence of migrant 
agency  and  brincando  (job  jumping).  according  to  the  literature,  immigrant  workers 
adjust to exploitation, discrimination, and blocked mobility in the secondary labor market 

93

identifying and measuring the lifelong human capital of unskilled migrants by shifting back and forth between jobs in the informal and ethnic economies, but rarely 
experiencing real economic mobility (sassen 1989; zlolniski 1994; theodore, valenzuela, 
and melendez 2006; light 2006). in contrast, we find that roughly one-third of the sample 
transitioned to higher skilled and more prestigious jobs across the migratory circuit.  mens 
transitions to higher paid and more skilled occupations were greatest in the us, reflecting 
the  skills,  especially  construction-  related  ones,  they  brought  with  them  from  mexico, 
along with their greater occupational choices and skill opportunities relative to women who 
entered the us labor market as domestics, chambermaids, and low-skilled food preparation 
workers.  but  men  also  gained  from  reskilling  in  the  us,  especially  in  automotive  and 
construction work. in guanajuato, skills acquired in the us also allowed returnees to cater 
to a growing expatriate population and other return migrants seeking to build homes in 
the american style. while some women moved on to higher-skilled jobs in the us, many 
remain trapped in low-wage domestic and hospitality work. on the other hand, on some 
levels women trumped men upon return, reflecting their ability to mobilize their english 
language capital and social skills learned in the us to land better jobs.

finally, we can see from table 10 that overall, both men and women upgraded their skills 
across the migratory circuit, moving from low-skill jobs characterized by repetitive tasks 
(dishwasher, leather cutter) to semi-skilled jobs, defined as those that involve multi-tasking 
or the mastery of a specific skill (see table 1).  men were more likely than women to 
transition to semi-skilled jobs upon return, reflecting the different entry jobs of men and 
women upon return and the more limited occupational choices for women.  reintegration 
into the mexican labor market was more difficult for women than men, but most women 
appeared to benefit economically and socially from migration.  some faced institutional 
discrimination because of age; for others, it took time to market their english language 
capital  and  interpersonal  and  customer  service  skills  acquired  in  the  us.   as  a  result, 
upon return, some of the women first entered traditional jobs requiring few skills, such 
as domestic service, but some managed to transition to semi-skilled jobs requiring multi-
tasking, such as food preparation and customer service or english and customer service. 

conclusion 
to explain the variability in learning and skill transfers among migrants with low levels 

94

journal on migration and human securityof formal human capital and to distinguish their labor market experiences from the highly 
skilled,  we  have  engaged  the  literature  on  learning  and  knowledge  transactions  which 
recognizes multiple types of knowledgeboth codified and tacitalong with the social 
contexts in which they are created.  we find that unlike migrants whose human capital 
is largely acquired in formal learning environments leading to credentialed and codified 
knowledge, migrants with low levels of education acquire most of their skills informally 
through interaction and observation both on and off the job. this is not to say that migrants 
with formal credentials do not acquire some skills informally before migration, but that for 
migrants with low levels of formal education, job skills are learned predominantly in social 
contexts rather than classrooms and thus are often hidden skills.  it is therefore especially 
important  that  the  assessment  of  migrant  welfare  gains  according  to  models  of  human 
capital account for the acquisition of lifelong human capital.
the literature on learning and knowledge transactions also sheds light on the non-technical 
skills and knowledge migrants acquire in their workplaces, or what evans (2002) refers to 
as social methodological, and practical competences. the literature on skilled migration 
has begun to recognize that language capital and social competences acquired or improved 
in workplaces abroad can be transforming, enhancing social status and self- esteem upon 
return (williams 2007b).  but as we argue in this paper, the acquisition of competences is 
not limited to the skilled, but is dispersed across jobs and labor markets. 
our research also suggests that the occupational and industrial context of learning and 
skill transfers matter.  on- and off-the-job work experience in construction and automotive 
repair is easily transferrable to the us and back to mexico, where demand for these services 
is high. other skills are place-specific and cannot be transferred (e.g., the techniques used 
in roofing and some aspects of agriculture in the us are not applicable to work in mexico), 
while others are easily transferable (e.g., metalworking, automotive repair, and english 
language  skills),  especially  in  large  cities  with  a  diverse  industrial  base  and  wherever 
demand for language capital is high. 
our study has broad implications for the migration policies of both the us and mexico.  us 
immigration policy confers preference to skilled immigrants who rank high on traditional 
human capital characteristics, such as education levels and other formal credentials, but 
limits  the  entry  of  unskilled  migrants,  a  categorization  that  ignores  the  substantial 
informal skills they bring to us labor markets.  instead of focusing only on the continued 
expansion of immigration policy preferences for narrowly defined skilled migrants, the us 
government needs to consider more carefully what we mean by skilled workers and design 
fairer and more effective immigration policies that match their abilities to the specific needs 
of us industry and thereby recognize the economic contributions of all migrants within a 
lifelong human capital framework.  mexico can also learn from our findings. between 
2005  and  2010  an  estimated  1.4  million  mexicans  returned  to  mexico  from  the  us,  a 
figure roughly double the number who had returned in the five-year period a decade earlier 
(passel  et  al.  2012). the  government  of  mexico  has  a  history  of  developing  programs 
to provide for mexicans abroad and encourage their remittances. our research indicates 
that the mexican people and their economy would benefit by supporting entrepreneurial 
ventures  and  reintegration  programs  that  recognize  and  reward  the  enhanced  skill  sets 
of return migrants. as we have shown, some of these individuals are able to fill valued
