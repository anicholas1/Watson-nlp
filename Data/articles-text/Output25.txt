executive summary
children make up half of the worlds refugees, yet limited research documents 
the views of youth about migratory causes and recommendations. while 
there is wide recognition of migrant childrens right to free expression, few 
opportunities exist to productively exercise that right and provide input 
about their views. this article analyzes the responses of central american 
and mexican migrant children to one interview question regarding how to 
help youth like themselves, and identifies several implied no-win situations 
as potential reasons for the migration decisions of unaccompanied children. 
furthermore, the childrens responses highlight the interconnected nature 
of economics, security, and education as migratory factors. examination of 
childrens political speech revealed primarily negative references regarding 
their home countrys government, the president, and the police. the police 
were  singled  out  more  than  any  other  public  figures,  with  particular 
emphasis  on  police  corruption  and  ineffectiveness.  additional  analysis 
focused on childrens comments regarding migration needs and family.
recommendations for future action include:
  recognizing entwined motivations and no-win situations that may lead 

children to leave their countries of origin;

introduction

in 2015, children3 comprised 51 percent of the globes 21.3 million refugees (unhcr 
2016a). using a broader definition, unicef estimates that 65 million children are on the 
move due to global hostilities, poverty, climate events, or the pull of opportunities abroad 
(2016). yet limited research documents the views  of  youth regarding migratory causes 
and recommendations (gryc 2016). this omission of youth perspectives ignores young 
peoples rights to have a say in matters affecting them. furthermore, it risks misunderstanding 
and misrepresenting what young people think about their circumstances, and it overlooks 
young people as potential resources and leaders in seeking solutions to the problems that 
affect them and, by extension, their communities. this article considers the central research 
question,  what  can  we  learn  from  the  observations  and  recommendations  of  central 
american and mexican unaccompanied migrant children themselves? by analyzing the 
responses  of  central american  and  mexican  migrant  children  to  a  question  regarding 
how  to  help  youth  like  themselves,  and  then  concludes  with  policy  and  programming 
recommendations. 
the united states witnessed unprecedented levels of central american unaccompanied 
child migration in 2014 (orr 2015; usbp 2015), short-term decreases in 2015 (rosenblum 
and ball 2016), followed by a return to increased central american apprehensions at the 
southern us border that continue well above historical averages (usbp 2016; burnett 
2016). el salvador and honduras, with guatemala close behind, trade positions at or near 
the top of lists of the worlds most violent countries or the nations containing the most 
homicidal  cities  (the  economist  2016;  watts  2015;  instituto  igarap  n.d.).  persistent 
gang violence in this region, along with the push of economic strain and the pull of us 
opportunity (donato and sisk 2015; rosenblum 2015; unhcr 2014), seem to ensure that 
these migration patterns will continue for some time. this relentless violence, combined 
with  high  levels  of  criminal  impunity,  lead  to  mistrust  of  law  enforcement  to  address 
security issues (osji 2016; eguizbal et al. 2015). 
adding to existing literature reporting the reasons central american and mexican children 
leave home (unhcr 2014; unhcr and acnur 2014), this article examines previously 
3   the terms children and youth are used here interchangeably to refer to individuals under age 18, although 
in practice the term youth is more nebulous. the un secretariat defines youth as young people 
between the ages of 15 and 24, however this is not universally observed across un offices (undesa n.d.; 
unhcr 2013).

journal on migration and human securityunreported  childrens  responses  regarding  how  to  help  child  migrants  like  themselves. 
in analyzing the childrens own statements, this article also elevates the voices of youth 
as  an  important  component  in  responding  to  migration  crises  globally,  concluding  that 
youth views can add nuance to understanding migration motivators and that in order to 
adequately respond to child migration and ultimately prevent  or at least reduce  the 
need to migrate, national and international policy makers must understand and integrate 
youth perspectives into the development of effective solutions. 
to  that  end,  this  article  engages  in  secondary  analysis  of  interview  data  with  404 
unaccompanied  central  american  and  mexican  teens,  previously  reported  on  in  the 
publication,  children  on  the  run:  unaccompanied  children  leaving  central  america 
and mexico and the need for international protection (unhcr 2014). this earlier report 
focused largely on data regarding childrens reasons for leaving their countries of origin, 
finding  that  at  least  58  percent  of  the  children  interviewed  were  potentially in  need  of 
international  protection  from  organized  armed  criminal  actors  or  violence  in  the  home 
(ibid.). hickey-moody (2016), discussing the dewey-informed concept of little public 
spheres (58), asks what if young people could be included in the public realm? what 
would they say and how would they say it? (62). these 404 unaccompanied children 
from el salvador, guatemala, honduras, and mexico provide valuable insight into their 
assessment of the problems that lead to youth migration and potential responses. in an era 
of global migration crises, their views deserve our attention.

literature review
a review of the relevant literature indicates both a recognition of migrant childrens right 
to free expression, along with an acknowledgement of the limited practical opportunities to 
productively exercise that right and provide input about their views.

youth voice

article 12 of the convention on the rights of the child enshrines the right of children 
to express their views on matters affecting them, while article 13 ensures their right to 
free  expression.4 together  these  articles  establish  the  right  of  children  to  participate  in 
circumstances in which they have an interest, while article 3 clarifies that the best interest 
of the child shall be a primary consideration5 in all actions that concern children. thus, 
children have the right to give their opinion and to have their best interests prioritized in 
decisions concerning them. 
yet  a  systematic  review  by  unhcr  of  its  youth  engagement  activities  concluded  that 
youth remain invisible within unhcr structures and beyond (unhcr 2013), while the 
organization continues its commitment to full age, gender, and diversity inclusion (unhcr 
2011). in a recent effort to mitigate this inattention to the particular needs and input of youth, 
unhcr and the womens refugee commission coordinated a series of 56 global refugee 

4   convention on the rights of the child (new york, 20 nov. 1989) 1577 u.n.t.s. 3, 28 i.l.m. 1448 
(1989), entered into force 2 sept. 1990.

they need to give us a voiceyouth consultations in 22 countries, culminating in a final global consultation at unhcr 
headquarters in june 2016 (gaynor 2016; gryc 2016). such efforts represent nascent 
steps towards incorporating the views of refugee youth into migration policymaking.  
a  very  limited academic literature focuses  on  the  voices  of  central american  children 
themselves, using narrative research with small sample sizes (berman 2000; bjrgo and 
jensen 2015), anecdotal accounts (georgopoulos 2005; nazario 2014; somers 2010), or 
grey  literature  reports  (unhcr  2014;  unhcr  and acnur  2014;  rosenblum  2015). 
anastario  and  coauthors  contribute  to  such  literature  through  secondary  analysis  of 
governmental  interviews  with  deported  youth  in  el  salvador,  who  indicated  family 
reunification, economics, and insecurity as their primary reasons for migrating in 2013 and 
2014 (anastario et al. 2015). a separate study in el salvador, which gathered data directly 
from  active  and  at-risk  gang-involved  youth  themselves,  found  that  a  low  orientation 
towards the future, low levels of empathy, combined with educational problems and peer 
relations with other delinquent or gang-involved youth, presented significant risk factors 
for youth violence and misconduct (olate, salas-wright and vaughn 2012). while small 
in scope, these studies suggest multifactorial explanations for both youth who migrate, 
and for youth who become involved in the gangs that can cause other youth to migrate. 
oversimplified descriptions misstate the inherent complexities for both young people who 
leave, and for young people who contribute to the dynamics causing others to leave. 

children and migration

childrens  reasons  for  migration  have  been  tied  to  their  parents  migration  patterns, 
suggesting generational or cyclical trends (donato and sisk 2015), while also demonstrating 
childrens own agency within migration decisions (khashu 2010; somers 2010). childrens 
approaches to migration differ from adult expectations, as they undertake less preparation 
and undervalue migration risks (khashu 2010), thus reminding policymakers that relying 
solely upon adult logic and priorities to understand youth behavior potentially overlooks 
the ways that maturity, age, experience, education, and access to resources, lead adults to 
understand things differently than young people. 
us policy decisions may also influence childrens migration. for example, a broad-based 
analysis  of  mexican  migration  suggests  that  politically  motivated  militarization  of  the 
us-mexico  border  inadvertently  locked  migrant  laborers  within  the  united  states,  so 
that family members had to migrate to the us to be reunited, thus initiating a shift from 
sojourning to settlement (massey 2015, 286). musalo and lee (forthcoming) convincingly 
argue that us policy has focused too much on an enforcement-based response to assumed 
pull factors while ignoring the significant protection-oriented push factors. this articles 
analysis  of  the  childrens  responses  suggests  that  clear  theoretical  distinctions  between 
push and pull factors may be difficult to recognize in reality due to the intertwined nature 
of  migration  dynamics.  simplistic  explanations  risk  underestimating  the  multilayered 
migratory reasoning that leads children to leave their countries of origin. understanding 
childrens own views adds necessary nuance to these complex dynamics.

research design

this  article  analyzes  previously  unpublished  data  based  on  responses  to  one  interview 
question from a larger 2014 unhcr study examining the root causes of unaccompanied 
child migration from el salvador, guatemala, honduras, and mexico. unhcr secured us 
government cooperation to conduct 404 qualitative interviews with youth ages 12 to 17 held 
in us federal custody. central american children were primarily interviewed in shelter care 
programs overseen by the office of refugee resettlement (orr) within the us department 
of health and human services (dhhs), and mexican children were primarily interviewed 
in detention holding areas of us border patrol stations near the texas-mexico border. this 
dataset uniquely captures the perspectives of children for whom migration decisions and 
transit experiences were still quite recent. in 2014, unhcr published the report, children 
on the run: unaccompanied children leaving central america and mexico and the need 
for international protection, focusing on childrens reasons for migration. 

original methodology

potential participants were randomly selected from those children meeting the designated 
nationality  and  age  population  characteristics.  the  gender  breakdown  averaged  77 
percent male and 23 percent female (intentionally mirroring the gender composition of 
unaccompanied children in orr custody), with nationality variations ranging from a low 
of 4 percent female among mexican youth interviewed, to a high of 35 percent female 
among salvadoran youth interviewed.6 
to  mimic  the  institutional  review  board  process  existing  within  academic  institutions, 
unhcr shared its research methodology and instruments with 14 external child migration 
experts  and  subsequently  integrated  their  recommendations.  in  addition,  unhcrs 
headquarters-level offices for child protection, and for policy development and evaluation 
services, reviewed and commented on the research methodology and materials.
potential participants received informed consent explanations in small groups and then 
individually,  including  the  childrens  rights  to:  participate  voluntarily,  terminate  the 
interview,  decline  to  answer  questions,  speak  with  an  on-site  clinician  following  the 
interview, and expect confidential treatment of their responses. interviewers also explained 
the limits of confidentiality in the event that a child reported that someone was harming 
him or her, that the child wanted to harm himself or herself, or that the child wanted to 
harm another person. further, children were informed of the potential risks of and benefits 
from participation. interviews were semi-structured, using a mix of closed ended and open-
ended questions in a standard format. interviewers were able to ask clarifying questions, or 
to modify the order of questions based upon how children wanted to tell their story. 

6   the extreme gender imbalance among mexican children present in the border patrol stations and 
federally funded shelters warrants further exploration but is beyond the scope of this article.

they need to give us a voicesecondary analysis

unhcr granted this author access to several subsets of the children on the run interview 
data in order to consider the research question, what can we learn from the observations 
and recommendations of central american and mexican unaccompanied migrant children 
for helping children like themselves? childrens responses to the following question were 
analyzed: tienes ideas de cmo podemos mejor ayudar a otros jvenes que salieron de 
sus pases? [do you have ideas about how we can better help other youth who leave their 
countries?]. in some interviews, this question also included the variant, what would have 
to be different for you to have stayed? to help children consider what would have helped 
them, in order to also think about what would help others. responses include a combination 
of particular and general observations and recommendations.
unhcr requested and was granted permission to review this articles findings prior to 
publication, solely in order to ensure the data was used ethically and in a manner consistent 
with the consent forms signed by the children. for the analysis in this article, conducted 
independently of the unhcr report, the institutional review board of the university of 
st. thomas (st. paul, mn) reviewed and approved the research plan. 
data was provided as an excel spreadsheet and included 404 childrens biographical data 
(gender,  age,  nationality)  and  responses  to  the  question  described  above  (access  to  the 
interviews in their entirety was not provided). grounded theory data analysis involved an 
initial round of elaborative coding based on theoretical constructs familiar from the prior 
research (saldaa 2009, 168), followed by axial coding to identify subthemes, and inter-
related pattern coding focused on economics, security, and education, as well as politics, 
migration needs, and family references (miles, huberman, and saldaa 2014). a random 
selection of coded data was reviewed by a colleague for inter-rater reliability, resulting in 
coding agreement and confidence in coded themes.

findings
childrens  responses  to  this  one  question  incorporated  a  mix  of  their  own  needs  and 
generalizations about the needs of others. an initial review for themes revealed recurring 
references to: economics, security, politics, education, migration needs, and family, along 
with several idiosyncratic comments. these responses were categorized and counted by 
gender and nationality for comparison purposes (see table 1). comments regarding the 
interaction of economics, security, and education (or more specifically work, gangs, and 
school) were extracted as pattern codes and analyzed separately. 
in the abstract, the three elements of economics, security, and education, may be conceived 
of as different spheres of experience, but the interview results reveal that in the reality of 
these childrens daily lives, they are inextricably linked. this is not uncommon. as bhabha 
observes,  while  human-rights  instruments  and  discourse  emphasize  the  importance 
of educational goals . . . most migrant adolescents aspire to employment opportunities 
as a precondition not a sequel to postprimary education. . . . these two issues are often 
intertwined in the life of adolescent migrants (2014, 247-48).

the observations of migrant children analyzed in this article add a third issue  security 
  as  a  serious  danger  that  appears  to  be  intertwined  with  education  and  employment 
motives underlying migration choices for the central american and mexican migrant youth 
participating in this study. these three domains of education, security, and economics, were 
frequently mentioned together, revealing their interrelated nature. the following responses 
demonstrate instances in which children mentioned all three domains in the same response. 
for example:
 

they need better education. there arent jobs that pay enough for someone to go to 
school.7 children dont go to school, instead they get involved with gangs and start 
robbing. (17-year-old honduran male)
there you study, but there are no jobs. because they cant get jobs, they think its 
better to go to the street or the girls just start having children. (17-year-old salvadoran 
male)
i dont know, if there were more police presence or more resources to create centers 
to help children to not get involved in gangs. some kids say they dont want to study 
any more, or they dont want to work, they only work to earn money to buy cocaine or 
marijuana. many young people, 17 years old, leave school so they can join the gangs. 
i think there should be some kind of center where they can go and get classes and have 
an option to not be involved in the gang. (17-year-old salvadoran female)

 

 

7   students may have to pay for a combination of tuition, textbooks, uniforms, community contributions, 
and/or other fees, as well as transportation (bentaouett 2006). 

63

they need to give us a voice 

  there are people who dont have money to enroll their children in school. and when 

children dont go to school they end up in the cartels. (17-year-old mexican male)
many young people would study if they had the opportunity to, but to do that their 
parents need to work. many young people cant keep studying because their parents 
dont have work. the gangs  sometimes people that dont like to work or cant find 
work, most of them destroy their families and get used to being on the street. (17-year-
old guatemalan male)

to  grasp  the  warp  and  weft  of  these  three  intertwining  elements,  they  were  treated  as 
pattern codes and mapped as separate visual displays arranged by nationality. images of the 
salvadoran and guatemalan displays are included below to represent the most significant 
contrast in these visual displays. 
pattern  coding  revealed  that  children  frequently  mentioned  economics,  security,  and 
education  issues  in  relation  to  one  another.  for  the  children  from  el  salvador,  the 
relational comments focused more on the connections between economics and security, 
and education and security (see figure 1). guatemalan children placed greater emphasis 
on the relationship between education and economics (see figure 2). the comments from 
honduran and mexican children were more evenly distributed among all three domains.

implicit no-win situations 

when all of the childrens comments were considered as a composite, several implicit no-
win situations became evident, particularly related to economics, security, and education. 
whether employed or unemployed, school enrolled or unenrolled, young people face risks 
from  gangs  and  crime.  similarly,  education  necessitates  employment,  yet  employment 
requires education. how does a young person get ahead in this rigged situation?
the childrens comments below illustrate the no-win relationship between economics and 
security.

economics  security

on the one hand, not working increases childrens risks of joining or being forcibly recruited 
into  a  gang  (due  to  idle  or  unsupervised  time).  on  the  other  hand,  working  or  having 
resources increases the risk of being targeted by a gang for theft or extortion. for example:
 
gangs are increasing because of the economy, because there arent enough jobs. kids 
think its better to rob and steal because they dont see any other way to make money. 
(17-year-old salvadoran female)
anything you have, the gang members take from you. sometimes gang members will 
wait for you outside banks, then attack you and rob you. (16-year-old salvadoran 
male)

journal on migration and human security security  education 

another, no-win situation surfaced in the relationship between security and education. not 
attending school increases the risk of children being recruited into a gang (due to idle or 
unsupervised time). however, attending school increases the risk of being targeted by a 
gang (for harassment or recruitment by gang-connected individuals within, near, or on the 
way to school). these childrens quotes further illustrate this predicament:
 

children in honduras dont have the education they need. sometimes they end up in 
gangs because they dont study. (14-year-old honduran male) 
there you have to pay a lot just to be enrolled in school. some kids go to school and 
they get kidnapped. just because they want to study and get ahead in life, they get 
kidnapped and they get ransomed. there is so much insecurity in honduras. (17-year-
old honduran male)

 

 education  economics 

finally,  there  is  a  correlation  in  their  responses  between  education  and  economics.  on 
the one hand, well-paid work is necessary in order to pay for education (e.g., school fees, 
uniforms, supplies), while an education is necessary in order to obtain well-paid work. 
indeed, even some youth with an education are not able to find meaningful work because 
of a lack of jobs in the overall economy. these quotes reveal a sense of frustration:
 

they need better education. there arent jobs that pay enough for someone to go to 
school. children dont go to school, instead they get involved with gangs and start 
robbing. (17-year-old honduran male)
jobs require experience, and how can you get experience if they dont give you a 
job? there are gang members because there are children that havent been given an 
education. (16-year-old guatemalan male)
i tried to get a job after i graduated, but there are no jobs. you also have to continue your 
education and get specialized. you cant do that if you dont have money. (17-year-old 
honduran female)

 

 

these implied no-win scenarios reveal an underlying calculation that may be made by 
children and/or their families when making migration decisions. because of the no-win 
analyses, children, and their families, may conclude that migration is the only choice the 
child has to get ahead, or, in many cases, merely to survive. instead of decisions based on a 
childs best interests, this may lead to decisions based on the least worst options.
this migratory calculus is evident, for example, in response to a separate interview question 
by a 17-year-old honduran male: my grandmother wanted me to leave. she told me: if 
you dont join, the gang will shoot you. if you do join, the rival gang will shoot you  or 
the cops will shoot you. but if you leave, no one will shoot you. (unhcr 2014, 10). in 
this honduran young mans retelling  as in the no-win scenarios described above  
migration was the only alternative to avoid being killed.
recognizing the existence of no-win situations from which child migrants flee supports 
the  observations  of  musalo  and  lee  (forthcoming)  that  adopting  solely  a  pull  factor 

67

they need to give us a voiceassessment  (e.g.,  that  us  factors  draw  migrants)  to  explain  recent  increases  in  central 
american migration is misguided. from a global policy perspective, recognizing such no-
win scenarios raises questions about how both to respond humanely in the short term to 
those who lack viable options to migration, and to also work over the longer term toward 
creating safe and appealing alternatives to migration and promoting self-determination by 
giving youth reasons to stay in their home countries.

political speech

childrens responses regarding public officials was coded as political speech,8 because 
of the references to those with public power. given the differing contexts for children from 
four different countries, the recurring words government, police, corrupt/ion, and 
president (along with their variants) were counted and analyzed as a common means of 
examining these childrens references to those in positions of public power. among these 
terms, references to government occurred most frequently overall (68 children), particularly 
from  mexican  youth  (25),  followed  by  guatemalan  youth  (15)  and  then  salvadoran 
and  honduran  youth  (14  references  each).  references  to  government  were  then  coded 
for pessimistic comments, in which 41 children noted that the government cannot, will 
not, or does not help (including this 12-year-old boy: in mexico, they dont help us, the 
government is corrupt). comments indicating some belief in the governments potential 
to act in a positive way to help or protect children were coded as possibility, including 
statements of what the government could, should or needs to do (e.g., the [guatemalan] 
government needs to control the extortions, robberies, and murders.) 
a total of 38 children mentioned the police, with the most references from salvadoran 
and honduran children (15 and 13 respectively), followed by six references to police by 
mexican children, and four by guatemalan children. police corruption was mentioned by 
21 children, most often hondurans, including this 15-year-old male: they should have a 
law against corruption. there [in honduras], a gang member goes to jail and is released the 
next day because the police are corrupt.
sixteen  children  emphasized  police  ineffectiveness,  including  a  17-year-old  salvadoran 
female  who  noted:  they  kill  there  in  broad  daylight  and  the  police  do  nothing.  in 
addition, eight children noted the need for more or better police, including this 17-year-old 
honduran male: if there were more police [in honduras] everything would be calmer. a 
17-year-old salvadoran male was among six youth who commented on the gangs being in 
control  there are cities [in el salvador] where the police are too afraid to go in because 
the gangs are the ones in control  while three children described situations of police 
harming the innocent, such as this 15-year-old mexican male: the [mexican] police will 
stop you and steal your money and beat you.
honduran and mexican children mentioned corruption more than other children, with nine 
and  eight  references,  respectively,  compared  to  four  references  by  salvadoran  children

8   this author limited coding of political speech to childrens references to public officials, sometimes 
referred to as state actors. the definition used in this article is narrower than that used by many legal 
scholars, which may also include references to both state actors and non-state actors as forms of political 
speech.

they need to give us a voiceand two by guatemalan children. in addition to police references, the term corruption was 
used in relation to the government or country in general 11 times. 
mexican youth referred to the president six times, while the other three nationalities each 
made four uses of the term president. the primary theme related to presidents was their 
ineffectiveness, including this comment by a 15-year-old honduran male: the president 
always says he will end the crime, but its always the same  he does nothing. another five 
children stated that the president needs to change or to be different, with this appraisal from 
a 16-year-old guatemalan male: we need a good president in guatemala; the presidents 
there only help the rich. 
the political speech analyzed in response to this one question came more from males  
18 were female (18 percent) and 79 male, compared to 23 percent female for the entire 
sample  with an average age of 16.13, higher than the entire samples overall average 
age of 15.83.

migration needs 

the 82 individual children whose ideas for helping other youth addressed migration needs 
largely focused on access to us territory and access to immigration benefits, as well as 
better treatment and protection. within this overall group, 30 children made generalized 
requests  to  let  migrants  enter  the  united  states;  a  17-year-old  guatemalan  female 
represented this response by saying, let them in, dont deport them. by contrast, five 
children demonstrated some migration ambivalence, such as this 17-year-old honduran 
male: it would be better to have work there and not have to come here. 
another 30 referenced a desire to expand migration benefits or protections, including this 
16-year-old guatemalan male: give work permission [in the us] so young people can 
work and help their families. fourteen children noted a need for better treatment towards 
migrants, particularly towards children, as noted by this 17-year-old male from mexico: 
in the us, i wish they could help more children with refuge.
finally, 11 children identified a need for more protection or help in transit, with some 
emphasizing the security needs en route, such as a 13-year-old salvadoran female who 
commented:  they  need  more  protection  from  the  gangs  in  el  salvador  and  from  the 
zetas on the journey. they kidnapped two people in mexico and had them hostage for 14 
days. others emphasized the need for help with basic needs such as goods and clothing, 
in addition to asking that officials not apprehend them, as this 17-year-old honduran male 
pled: tell the trains to go slowlytell immigration to not grab them so that they can pass. 
give them food, clothing  some people dont even have clothing.

family references

childrens  recommendations  regarding  relatives  included  39  references  to  family  or 
family  members,  with  recurring  themes  of  family  reunification,  helping  family,  and 
maltreatment  in  the  home.  seventeen  children  made  comments  about  the  need  for 
family reunification generally, such as the request of this 13-year-old honduran female:

help them so they can be with their families. that is the most important. some children 
referred to their desire to be reunited with a specific individual, primarily parents, such as 
this 13-year-old honduran female: i would like to stay here with my mom [in the united 
states]. 
in contrast to the 17 children who mentioned the need for family reunion, 11 spoke of 
problems in the home, such as the need for parental support or the need to be protected 
from abuse or neglect. a few children spoke of their own experiences of maltreatment in 
response to this particular question, such as this 16-year-old honduran female: i would 
stay [in honduras] if my grandmother would accept me with my baby and if she will take 
care of me. . . more often they spoke in generalized terms, only hinting at their own 
possible abuse or neglect, such as this 14-year-old mexican male: children in mexico, 
children like me, need help. they need parents who support them. i have seen other families 
where they have a mother and a father and the children are supported. every time i see that 
i feel sad because there are children that dont have that. 
eleven children talked about the desire to help family members remaining in the home 
country, with responses like this 17-year-old salvadoran female: give us the ability to 
work and to help our families. some children, like this 15-year-old male from honduras,

stayed if i had been able to make money and invest it so that i could help my family. 
i dont know how to protect them. there are lots of gangs. others were motivated by 
helping a specific family member in a specific way, such as the 14-year-old guatemalan 
female who stated: i would have stayed if i had had a better paying job that would really 
let me help my little sisters. these childrens responses demonstrate the varied roles that 
family relationships play in migration decisions: family can be a pull factor drawing youth 
to the united states for reunification purposes; family can be a push factor in order to 
economically maintain the same family that one leaves behind; family, or lack thereof, can 
be a push factor giving children a reason to leave, such as the 13-year-old honduran girl 
who stated, help the kids that are on the street, that do not have family and they look for a 
better life. for young people, the developmental need to love and be loved may outweigh 
any legal repercussions of migration.

discussion
this secondary analysis of central american and mexican migrant childrens interview 
responses documents the interconnected nature of economics, security, and education as 
migratory factors. in addition, certain no-win situations were implicit in the childrens 
responses, suggesting no-win situations as potential reasons for the migration decisions 
of unaccompanied children and their families. examination of childrens political speech 
revealed that 97 children spoke in primarily negative terms of the government, the president, 

72

journal on migration and human securitythe police, or corruption, revealing much greater pessimism than optimism regarding the 
potential for those in power to improve circumstances. the police were singled out more 
than  any  other  public  figures,  with  comments  saying  that  the  police  were  corrupt  and 
ineffective, the country needed more or better police, the gangs were in control (rather than 
the police), and, in a few instances, the police harm the innocent. 
childrens comments regarding migration indicate that these child migrants request and 
recommend more access to the united states and to legal migration, while a few disclose 
some  migration  ambivalence.  some  children  recommend  better  treatment  of  migrant 
children, and greater protection and concrete help for children and other migrants in transit. 
finally, childrens family references recognize their desires to be reunited with family, to 
be supported and protected in the home, and to help family members remaining in their 
home country.
these findings provide further support for unhcrs earlier analysis of this same sample of 
children regarding their reasons for leaving home, which included family or opportunity, 
violence in society, abuse in the home, deprivation, and other idiosyncratic reasons 
(unhcr 2014, 7). to that previous research, this article adds nuance to our understanding 
of  childrens  perspectives  regarding  the  inter-related  nature  of  economic,  security,  and 
education  issues,  suggesting  that  these  issues  cannot  be  considered  in  isolation  and 
that  migrant  children  may  have  entwined  motivations  for  migrating  that  defy  simple 
categorization. furthermore, this article contributes a more in-depth examination of data 
from one question, and begins to lay the groundwork for a theory of child migration based 
on no-win situations, suggesting that children and their families may choose migration 
when faced with dangerous or deficient options.
the practical implications of these findings include their application by refugee and asylum 
adjudicators in corroborating the conditions of violence, corruption, and deprivation (both 
economic  and  educational)  experienced  by  young  people  in  el  salvador,  guatemala, 
honduras, and mexico. recognition of the interrelated nature of economics, security, and 
education for young people from these countries should encourage adjudicators to consider 
and inquire about related security issues when children mention economic or educational 
issues in isolation. for example, if child asylum seekers articulate educational reasons for 
coming to the united states, adjudicators (as well as legal service providers) should probe 
behind the reasons why children could not continue their education in the home country. 
similarly,  children  interviewed  for  refugee  or  asylum  status  who  indicate  economic 
motivations for migration should be queried further regarding any specific reasons that the 
child or family could not economically support themselves. 
these  childrens  expressed  concerns  regarding  police  and  government  corruption  are 
buttressed by other reports that identify corruption in el salvador, honduras, guatemala, 
and mexico as ongoing problems contributing to a lack of citizen security and undermining 
public  confidence  in  the  political  system  (unhcr  2016b,  2016c;  dos  2015a,  2015b, 
2015c,  2015d;  olson  and  zaino  2015,  42).  cruz  (2015)  specifically  connects  police 
performance with overall political perceptions: the police play a fundamental role in any 
political regime. whether an authoritarian regime or a liberal democracy, police actions 
are intertwined with regime performance as they showcase the states response to day-
to-day issues (252). one journalist quotes a honduran police chief recognizing that up 

73

they need to give us a voiceto 20 percent of his own police force is dirty, while community leaders living in the 
same area increase this estimate of corrupt law enforcement officers to half of the local 
force (nazario 2016). apart from educators, police may be the government actors with 
whom youth most interact; hence, police treatment of young people has direct relevance to 
refugee and asylum claims.
analyzing childrens political speech in response to this one question confirms the potential 
for youth to hold political views, whether burgeoning, sophisticated, or somewhere in-
between. adults  at  times  presume  political  disinterest  among  young  people,  yet  these 
children made comments suggesting political concern, and at times cynicism, regarding the 
corruption and perceived ineffectiveness of those in positions of power. the question posed 
to these children was not specifically political in nature, yet 97 children (24 percent of the 
total number interviewed) used terms indicating political speech (individual children may 
have used more than one of the terms counted in table 2). given this research, refugee and 
asylum adjudicators should recognize the ability of youth to hold political views, whether 
nascent or mature.
serido  and  colleagues  (2011)  make  a  connection  between  youth  voice  and  identity 
development, suggesting that giving youth opportunities to put their voices into action 
(56) can nurture the sense that they matter. the childrens comments analyzed for this 
article indicate that they have relevant views about what would improve their circumstances 
and their societies. more explicit examination of central american and mexican migrant 
youths sense of power within their home communities may reveal ways in which countries 
and communities of origin can empower youth by giving them a voice regarding their own 
futures. as stated by the 17-year-old salvadoran girl cited in this articles title, sometimes 
adults view children as lesser and they think we cant become anything or dont have an 
opinion. they dont ask for our view on things. they need to give us a voice.
taken together, these childrens comments signal the need for holistic responses at national 
and international levels, in order to mitigate the no-win scenarios that appear to contribute 
to the migration of children. such a holistic approach to addressing migration events fits 
with  the  ecological  perspective  in  social  work,  which  emphasizes  the  interdependence 
between people and their environments and the resulting reciprocal exchanges in which 
persons impact their environment at the same time that they are impacted by it (gitterman 
and germain 2008). as public and private actors work together to change the dynamics 
leading to migration, they must collaborate and recognize how their efforts impact the work 
of others and are impacted in return. in more concrete terms, efforts to create well-paying 
work must also consider educational requirements, internship and job training opportunities, 
and how such approaches can compete with, and be undermined by, the seduction and 
threats of gangs and cartels. efforts to improve educational opportunities for young people 
must also practically consider the economic requirements for children and their families 
to afford school attendance, along with the ways that schools can simultaneously mitigate 
the lure of criminal activity, while unintentionally facilitating recruitment and harassment 
by  gang-connected  peers  and  adults.  efforts  to  address  security  issues,  particularly  in 
relation to gangs and cartels, must also address the economic, educational, and political 
environment that has made illicit activity attractive, unavoidable, or involuntary. 

74

journal on migration and human securityas international aid to this region increases, programmatic approaches should be coordinated 
and  interconnected.  equally  important,  youth  should  be  involved  in  the  planning  and 
implementation  of  these  interventions,  if  there  is  to  be  hope  of  success.  the  global 
refugee youth consultations led by unhcr and the womens refugee commission (and 
described in the introduction) demonstrate one possible model for such youth engagement, 
particularly  if  these  gatherings  can  be  translated  into  concrete  action.  programs  that 
implement the principles of positive youth development, and youth community organizing 
or mobilization, provide a grassroots approach to harnessing young peoples ideas around 
issues of importance to them in a manner that is sustainable and develops youth leadership 
capacity (wola 2008). 
a  segment  of  these  childrens  interview  responses  reveals  a  palpable  frustration  and 
pessimism,  even  resignation,  about  the  corruption,  selfishness,  and  maltreatment  they 
identify  in  the  adults  with  responsibility  for  their  protection  (police,  politicians,  and 
sometimes caregivers). this sample of child participants represents a specific segment of 
the population  those who decided to leave their countries of origin. to the extent that 
they represent the views of at least some of their peers who have not or cannot leave, 
they signal a concerning sense of mistrust, particularly towards those in power. christens 
and dolan (2011) argue that youth community organizing can benefit the development of 
youth leadership and capacity, can improve community development, and can strengthen 
interactions between youth and adults. such positive outcomes depend upon listening to 
youth views, developing youth leadership in order to effect change, and sharing power with 
youth in authentic ways through intergenerational collaboration (ibid.). 
in  december  2015,  president  barack  obama  signed  into  law  the  consolidated 
appropriations act  designating  up  to  $750  million  in  aid  and  economic  development 
funds for central america. the act requires that certain pre-conditions be met regarding 
border security, corruption, and human rights, before 75 percent of the funds are released 
(meyer  2016; white  house  2016;  beltrn  2015). the  results  of  the  research  described 
in this article provide some broad suggestions for how youth themselves might allocate 
these funds, particularly in addressing economic, security, and educational issues. concrete 
recommendations include prioritizing well-paying jobs, increasing protection from gangs 
and cartels, and supporting high-quality, accessible education. hanson (2016) identifies 
a lack of coordination (12) as a regional handicap in promoting collaboration between 
government entities working on different aspects of youth opportunity programming in the 
northern triangle of central america. these children identify the need for their nations 
to  address  issues  of  economics,  security,  and  education  in  a  coordinated  manner  that 
recognizes the intersecting nature of these domains. the record level of us government 
funding committed in 2016 presents an opportunity to intentionally nurture and develop 
future ethical leaders who can help create conditions in which the next generation will be 
able to remain and contribute to their homeland. 

recommendations
in summary, concrete policy recommendations emerging from this research include the 
following:

75

they need to give us a voice1.  recognizing entwined motivations and no-win situations that may lead children 
to leave their countries of origin. refugee and asylum adjudicators should recognize 
that migration motivators are interconnected, and that economic or educational motives 
do not preclude related security concerns. furthermore, in-country policymakers and 
service providers should identify and seek solutions to perceived no-win situations. 

2.  promoting  integrated  approaches  to  home  country  economic,  security,  and 
education concerns for central american and mexican youth. refugee and asylum 
adjudicators  should  probe  childrens  economic  and  educational  reasons  for  leaving 
home to explore the possibility of interrelated security reasons leading to migration. 
for example, if a child mentions a desire to work or attend school in the united states, 
adjudicators should also inquire about circumstances impeding these options in the 
childs home country.

3.  acknowledging migrant childrens political interests and concerns. refugee and 
asylum adjudicators should recognize the ability of children to hold political views, 
even if these views are nascent or immature from an adults perspective.

4.  providing  youth  with  meaningful  opportunities  to  contribute  their  views  and 
suggestions. adults working with migrant youth, in the united states, in transit, and in 
home countries, should proactively seek out means for youth to contribute their views 
and suggestions, as a means of empowering youth, and of better understanding youth 
perspectives that may differ from adults views.

5.  incorporating  migrant  childrens  input  and  concerns  into  spending  plans  for 
us  aid  appropriated  for  central  america.  us  and  international  aid  to  central 
america and mexico should seek out practical collaborative ways to address the root 
causes  of  migration  across  economic,  security,  and  educational  spheres  of  practice. 
for example, law enforcement efforts focused on reducing gang and cartel violence 
should incorporate positive youth development approaches through skill-building and 
rehabilitative programming, such as partnering with education and training programs 
for at-risk youth.

6.  emphasizing youth leadership development in efforts to address child migration. 
international  and  domestic  programmatic  efforts  to  stem  child  migration  should 
include youth leadership development, to nurture future ethical leaders who can create 
conditions in which the next generation will be able to remain and contribute to their 
families and homelands.

 future research
as an interviewer and researcher on the original study, this author is familiar with the full 
breadth of the childrens responses. however, this article, which represents exclusively 
the authors own opinions, analyzes responses to only one question out of the entirety of 
each childs interview. readers interested in a fuller picture of these childrens interview 
responses should refer to the earlier findings of the unhcr children on the run report 
(2014). 

76

journal on migration and human securitythe participants in this study represent only those children who left their countries of origin. 
additional  research  could  analyze  the  views  of  children  who  remain  in  their  countries 
of origin to examine how their views differ from those who left. unhcr found that 36 
percent of the children in its study had one or both parents in the united states (2014, 63). a 
complementary study could focus on those children with relatives in the united states who 
nonetheless chose to remain in their home countries. what factors in their lives counter the 
push and pull of migration? what efforts or circumstances are successful in giving children 
the security, or opportunity, needed to remain rooted in their home communities? 
future research could more specifically engage unaccompanied children in their perceived 
roles in relation to politics, political speech, public policy most relevant to youth, how 
migration impacts family relationships, and youth views on power (e.g., how age, gender, 
and diversity impact their perceived ability to create change in their lives and communities). 
ultimately, the analysis in this article provides a platform for the voices of these youths to 
be heard by those with the power to act and create positive changes in central america and 
mexico. these youth are asking for a say in their future. who is listening?
