health insurance coverage for americans with  

pre-existing conditions: 

the impact of the affordable care act 

 

january 5, 2017 

 
the affordable care act (aca) put in place a range of nationwide protections for americans 
with pre-existing health conditions. under the aca, insurance companies cannot deny coverage 
or charge higher premiums based on a persons medical history or health status. in addition, 
policies cannot exclude coverage for treating a pre-existing condition, must include limits on out-
of-pocket spending, cannot include limits on annual or lifetime coverage, and, in the case of most 
individual and small group market policies, must cover essential health benefits.   
 
in 2011, prior to the implementation of the acas major health insurance reforms in 2014, 
aspe examined the impact of the acas pre-existing conditions protections.1 the 2011 analysis 
found that between 50 and 129 million non-elderly americans had pre-existing health conditions 
and would gain new protections under the aca reforms.2   
 
this analysis updates that earlier study. it confirms that a large fraction of non-elderly 
americans have pre-existing health conditions: at least 23 percent of americans (61 million 
people) using a narrow definition based on eligibility criteria for pre-aca state high-risk pools, 
or as many as 51 percent (133 million people) using a broader definition closer to the 
underwriting criteria used by insurers prior to the aca. any of these 133 million americans 
could have been denied coverage, or offered coverage only at an exorbitant price, had they 
needed individual market health insurance before 2014.  this analysis also offers a first look at 
how health insurance coverage for people with pre-existing conditions actually changed when 
the acas major insurance market reforms took effect in 2014. it finds that, between 2010 and 
2014, the share of americans with pre-existing conditions who went without health insurance all 
year fell by 22 percent, a drop of 3.6 million people. the acas individual market reforms 
appear to have played a key role in these gains.

after dropping by about a quarter between 2010 and 2014, the uninsured rate for all non-elderly 
americans has fallen an additional 22 percent through the first half of 2016.3 while data for 
americans with pre-existing conditions are available only through 2014, it is likely that this 
group has also seen continued gains in access to coverage and care over the past two years. 
 

key findings: 
  up to 133 million non-elderly americansjust over half (51 percent) of the non-elderly 

populationmay have a pre-existing condition. this includes 67 million women and girls 
and 66 million men and boys. 

  the likelihood of having a pre-existing condition increases with age: up to 84 percent of 

those ages 55 to 6431 million individualshave at least one pre-existing condition.  

  among the most common pre-existing conditions are high blood pressure (46 million 
people), behavioral health disorders (45 million people), high cholesterol (44 million 
people); asthma/chronic lung disease (34 million people), heart conditions (16 million 
people), diabetes (13 million people), and cancer (11 million people).  

  between 2010 and 2014, when the acas major health insurance reforms first took 

effect, the share of americans with pre-existing conditions who went uninsured all year 
fell by 22 percent, meaning 3.6 million fewer people went uninsured.  

  tens of millions of americans with pre-existing conditions experience spells of 

uninsurance.  about 23 percent (31 million) experienced at least one month without 
insurance coverage in 2014, and nearly one-third (44 million) went uninsured for at least 
one month during the two-year period beginning in 2013. 

 
 
how the aca reformed coverage for people with pre-existing conditions  
 
a pre-existing condition is a health condition that predates a person applying for or enrolling in a 
new health insurance policy. before the aca, insurers generally defined what types of 
conditions could constitute a pre-existing condition. their definitions frequently encompassed 
both serious conditions, such as cancer or heart disease, and less severe and more common 
conditions, such as asthma, depression, or high blood pressure.  
 
before the aca, individual insurers in the vast majority of states could collect information on 
demographic characteristics and medical history, and then deny coverage, charge higher 
premiums, and/or limit benefits to individuals based on pre-existing conditions. an industry 
survey found that 34 percent of individual market applicants were charged higher-than-standard 
rates based on demographic characteristics or medical history.4 similarly, a 2009 survey found

that, among adults who had individual market coverage or shopped for it in the previous three 
years, 36 percent were denied coverage, charged more, or had exclusions placed on their policy 
due to pre-existing conditions.5 a report by the government accountability office estimated 
that, as of early 2010, the denial rate among individual market applications was 19 percent, and 
the most common reason for denial was health status.6  
 
while some states attempted to offer some protection to people with pre-existing conditions, 
these efforts were generally not effective at ensuring access to affordable coverage.7 for 
example: 
 

  some states required that coverage be offered to people with pre-existing conditions, but 
imposed no restrictions on how much insurers could increase premiums based on health 
status. 
 

  some states required that coverage be offered to people with pre-existing conditions, but 

allowed insurers to exclude treatment for the pre-existing condition. thus, a cancer 
survivor could have obtained coverage, but that coverage would not have paid for 
treatment if the cancer re-emerged.  
 

  some states required that coverage be offered to people with pre-existing conditions, but 
only to those who met continuity of coverage requirements. in practice, a high fraction of 
people with pre-existing conditions go uninsured for at least short spells due to job 
changes, other life transitions, or periods of financial difficulty. about 23 percent of 
percent of americans with pre-existing conditions (31 million people) experienced at 
least one month without insurance coverage in 2014.  in the two-year period beginning in 
2013, nearly one-third (44 million) of individuals with pre-existing conditions went 
uninsured for at least one month. about 93 percent of those who were ever uninsured 
went without coverage for a spell of two months or more, and about 87 percent went 
without coverage for a spell of three months or more.8

  a few states sought to require that people with pre-existing conditions be offered 

coverage at the same price as other americans. but without accompanying measures to 
ensure that healthy residents also continued to buy insurance, these states saw escalating 
premiums that made health insurance unaffordable for sick and healthy residents alike.9  

in contrast, the aca implemented a nationwide set of reforms in the individual health insurance 
market. the law requires individual market insurers to offer comprehensive coverage to all 
enrollees, on common terms, regardless of medical history. meanwhile, the aca also includes 
measures to ensure a balanced risk pool that keeps coverage affordable. to directly improve 
affordability while encouraging individuals to buy coverage, the aca offers financial assistance 
for eligible taxpayers with household incomes up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level to 
reduce their monthly premium payments.10 the law also includes an individual shared 
responsibility provision that requires people who can afford coverage to make a payment if they 
instead elect to go without it.11 
 
prevalence of pre-existing conditions 
 
estimating the number of americans with pre-existing conditions  
 
this analysis updates earlier aspe estimates of the number of non-elderly americans potentially 
benefitting from the acas pre-existing conditions protections. as in the earlier study, we 
consider two definitions of pre-existing conditions. the narrower measure includes only 
conditions identified using eligibility guidelines from state-run high-risk pools that pre-dated the 
aca. these programs were generally intended to cover individuals who would be outright 
rejected for coverage by private insurers. the broader measure includes additional common 
health conditions (for example, arthritis, asthma, high cholesterol, hypertension, and obesity) and 
behavioral health disorders (including alcohol and substance use disorders, depression, and 
alzheimers) that could have resulted in denial of coverage, exclusion of the condition, or higher 
premiums for individuals seeking individual market coverage before the aca protections 
applied.12

we focus primarily on the broader measure, because individuals with any of these conditions 
were at risk of higher premiums and/or coverage carve-outs, if not outright coverage denials if 
they sought individual market health insurance before the aca protections applied. the 
narrower measure is similar to that used in a recent kaiser family foundation (kff) analysis, 
which finds that 52 million non-elderly adults would have been uninsurable in the individual 
market in most states before the aca. the kff study notes that its analysis does not attempt to 
include people with other health conditions that wouldnt necessarily cause a denial, but could 
lead to higher insurance costs based on underwriting.13 
 
both our narrow and broad estimates are based on the 2014 medical expenditure panel survey 
(meps), the most recent data available that provide both coverage and detailed health status 
information. the appendix provides a more detailed description of our methodology and 
supplemental tables.14 
 
the prevalence of pre-existing conditions in 2014 
 
as shown in table 1, we find that the aca is protecting between 23 and 51 percent of non-
elderly americans--61 to 133 million people--with some type of pre-existing health condition 
from being denied coverage, charged significantly higher premiums, subjected to an extended 
waiting period, or having their health insurance benefits curtailed should they need individual 
market health insurance coverage.  
 
certain groups are more likely than others to have pre-existing conditions. in particular, as 
people age, their likelihood of havingor ever having hada pre-existing health condition 
increases steadily. americans between ages 55 and 64 are particularly at risk: 49 to 84 percent of 
people in this age rangeup to 31 million peoplehave some type of pre-existing condition. by 
comparison, 6 to 24 percent of americans under the age of 18 have some type of pre-existing 
condition (see figure 1). approximately 56 percent of non-hispanic whites and individuals with 
family incomes above 400 percent of the federal poverty level have some type of pre-existing 
condition. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

                                                 
13 the authors also note that their analysis excludes certain conditions that likely would have led to coverage denials, 
including such as hepatitis c and hiv/aids. see gary claxton, cynthia cox, anthony damico, larry levitt, and 
karen pollitz, pre-existing conditions and medical underwriting in the individual market prior to the aca, kaiser 
family foundation, december 2016 (available at http://files.kff.org/attachment/issue-brief-pre-existing-conditions-
and-medical-underwriting-in-the-individual-insurance-market-prior-to-the-aca). 
14 all estimates cover individuals age 0 to 64 who did not have medicare coverage in any month. in addition to 
describing our methodology, the appendix explains technical changes that account for the substantial revision to our 
lower-bound estimate from the 2011 brief.

among the most common pre-existing conditions for non-elderly americans are high blood 
pressure, high cholesterol, behavioral health disorders (including, for example, alcohol and 
substance use disorders, depression, and alzheimers), asthma, arthritis, and obesity. millions of 
americans also have diabetes (13 million), heart conditions or heart disease (16 million), or have 
at some point been diagnosed with cancer (11 million). 
 
the impact of the acas protections in 2014 
 
as described above, the aca put in place a range of new protections designed to give 
individuals with pre-existing conditions, along with other americans, increased access to 
affordable health insurance. the 2014 meps data show that this is being borne out in practice, 
with significant improvements in health insurance coverage for americans with pre-existing 
conditions.  
 
as shown in table 3, between 2010 and 2014, the share of americans with pre-existing 
conditions who went uninsured all year fell from 13.8 percent to 10.7 percent, a drop of 22 
percent. these gains translated into 3.6 million fewer individuals with pre-existing conditions 
without health insurance.

notes: estimates based on broad definition of pre-existing conditions. a single individual can have 
multiple pre-existing conditions. differences in the estimated number of individuals with specific 
conditions are not necessarily statistically significant. 
 
figure 2 shows the source of these gains. while the share of americans with pre-existing 
conditions who had coverage through an employer remained roughly constant, the share with 
coverage through medicaid rose, and the share with individual market coverage increased 
substantially as pre-aca underwriting practices were phased out and marketplace subsidies 
became available (see appendix table 5).15

employer-sponsored coverage in any month, for example, were assigned to that category, even if they had months of 
enrollment in medicaid/chip, individual market coverage, or other public coverage, or were ever uninsured. 
because people move across sources of coverage in a year, more individuals may have had medicaid/chip, 
individual market coverage, or other public coverage than shown in figure 2. individual market coverage for 2014 
includes both marketplace and off-marketplace coverage. individuals categorized as uninsured were without 
coverage in any survey month.

figure 3 provides further confirmation that the aca is eliminating barriers in the individual 
market for americans with pre-existing conditions. in 2010, 54 percent of people with employer 
coverage had pre-existing conditions, similar to their share of the overall population. but in the 
individual market, only 46 percent of people had a pre-existing condition. by 2014, the 
composition of the individual market had shifted to nearly mirror the employer market, 
consistent with a market where insurers can no longer deny coverage based on health history.

conclusion 
 
with data available only through 2014, this analysis provides a preliminary picture of how the 
aca is helping individuals with pre-existing conditions. the uninsured rate for all americans, 
which fell by 27 percent between 2010 and 2014, fell another 22 percent between 2014 and 
2016, and people with pre-existing conditions have likely seen similar additional progress. 
nonetheless, this initial snapshot confirms that the acas insurance market reforms are 
providing important protections to the up to half of americans whose medical history previously 
put them at risk of being denied access to affordable health care.

appendix: methodology 
 
we used the 2014 medical expenditure panel survey (meps) to identify individuals who would 
likely been denied coverage due to a pre-existing condition if they were to apply for coverage in 
the individual market without the protections provided by the affordable care act. a multi-
pronged approach was used to identify conditions that would certainly or likely exclude 
individuals from being offered coverage. a list of pre-existing conditions was generated from 
two sources: eligibility guidelines from 19 pre-affordable care act high-risk pools and 
underwriting guidelines from seven major insurance carriers.16 the meps was used to identify 
whether individuals had a medical visit for any of these conditions, experienced any disability 
days (for the 2008 and 2010 data, as this information is no longer available in the 2014 data) as a 
result of any of these conditions, or reported that they were bothered by any of these conditions 
in the past year. additional questions regarding whether individuals had ever been diagnosed 
with a smaller set of conditions from these lists were used to further refine our measure.  
 
two estimates of the share of non-elderly individuals with pre-existing conditions are presented. 
the first includes only conditions that were identified using eligibility guidelines from high-risk 
pools; the second includes five additional common conditions (arthritis, asthma, high cholesterol, 
hypertension, and obesity) and a number of common behavioral health conditions that would 
have resulted in an automatic decline, exclusion of the condition, or higher premiums according 
to the seven pre-affordable care act insurer guidelines examined. the first estimate includes 
conditions that would have been very likely to cause an applicant to be denied coverage, and 
should be considered a lower bound estimate. the second estimate includes conditions that might 
result in a denial of coverage, but also might have resulted in a rate-up (that is, a higher 
premium) or a coverage rider (that is, a policy that excludes coverage for a pre-existing 
condition). 
 
analyses of the prevalence of particular conditions employ the categories used in the clinical 
classification software (ccs) developed for the healthcare cost and utilization project 
(hcup). a crosswalk between icd-9 and ccs categories is available at 
https://meps.ahrq.gov/data_stats/download_data/pufs/h170/h170app3.html. 
 
appendix tables 1-4 present the full set of estimates by age and insurance status for 2010 and 
2014, using both pre-existing conditions measures. appendix table 5 shows the change between 
2010 and 2014 in the distribution of insurance coverage among individuals with pre-existing 
conditions (broad definition only).

methodological refinements to 2011 analysis: 
 
the current analysis includes several methodological improvements relative to our 2011 analysis 
that improve the precision of our estimates. first, we identified a subset of individuals who had  
a condition meeting our narrower definition of a pre-existing condition, but who were incorrectly 
excluded from our estimates due to an error in coding. as a result of this correction, 1,237 
unweighted sample observations are newly classified as having a pre-existing condition under 
our narrower definition. when weighted these records correspond to approximately 13.4 million 
individuals. 
 
second, we adjusted the variable we used to define the age of individuals in the meps data, 
from age53x to age08x, to better capture the age of panel members during the year in which 
the data was collected. this change adds an additional 13 unweighted sample observations to the 
non-elderly population, which is eligible for both our first and second measures. when weighted, 
these observations represent nearly 200,000 additional eligible individuals.  
 
third, our current analysis uses full 5 digit icd-9 codes to specify conditions included in our 
two measures, provides additional precision to our estimates. these codes are not included in the 
publicly available data file, which provides only 3 digit icd-9 codes. this change reduces the 
number of unweighted sample observations included in the lower-bound measure by 230, 
representing nearly 2.4 million individuals, and 117 in the upper-bound measure, representing 
just over 1.1 million individuals.
