executive summary 

national health service corps  an extended analysis 

executive summary 

in this study we continue our analysis of the national health service corps (nhsc) with the 
purpose of gaining new insights into the programs performance regarding the distribution of 
providers in high-need areas.  the objective of this study is threefold.  first, we focus on the 
recent retention trends of nhsc program alumni in health professional shortage areas 
(hpsas).  second, we analyze the retention patterns of those nhsc participants who serve in 
indian health service (ihs) sites and compare them with that of all nhsc participants, and 
third, we examine the recruiting and retention effects of the program. 

in a previous project (lewin, 2014), we examined short- and long-term retention in hpsas of 
providers who participated in nhsc lrp and sp and compared their retention with the 
retention of non-participants working in those areas, using data from the period 2000-2013.  in 
the current study we increase the timeframe by adding two more years of nhsc administrative 
data (2014 and 2015) to determine whether the retention patterns changed over the more 
recent years, given the important recent program growth and changes.  we update and expand 
the data infrastructure we constructed for the previous project, and as before, we rely on data 
on nhsc program participants, provider360 data, medicare data and data on hpsa 
designations.  our current nhsc data covers the period between 2000 and 2015, the 
provider360 data is recorded as of january 2015, and the medicare data spans the period 
between 2005 and 2014.  the provider360 and the medicare data allow us to observe nhsc 
participants and their location after their separation from service.  combining their post-service 
location with information on whether that location is a hpsa or not, we construct hpsa 
retention statistics for all the program participants that we identified in provider360 or medicare 
data. 

to analyze retention patterns, similar to lewin (2014), we construct four variables: 

  serving in the same hpsa and in the same county.  this variable takes the value of 1 if 

the nhsc provider remains in the same county as the one where he or she served in 
nhsc, and 0 otherwise. 

  serving in a hpsa in another county.  this variable takes the value of 1 if the nhsc 

provider remains in a hpsa that is located in a different county than the one in which he 
or she served while in nhsc service, and 0 otherwise. 

  serving in a non-hpsa from the same county.  this variable takes the value of 1 if the 

nhsc provider moves to a non-hpsa area from the county where he or she served 
while in nhsc, and 0 otherwise. 

  serving in a non-hpsa in another county.  this variable takes the value of 1 if the nhsc 

provider moves to a non-hpsa area from another county than the county he or she 
served while in nhsc, and 0 otherwise. 

we create these measures for non-participants as well, but the reference point is not the year 
when they left service, but the first year (start year) they appear in the medicare data. using 
the above variables, we construct retention rates as the ratios between the number of providers 
in the same (or any) hpsa and the total number of providers leaving service in a given year.  
these rates are calculated one year after separation from nhsc, two years after separation 
from nhsc and so on.  in the case of non-participants (that are available to us from the 
medicare data and provider360 data), the annual retention rates are calculated one year since 
the start year, two years since the start year and so on for each cohort.

post-service hpsa retention analysis 

in figure es.1 we show that about 79% of the nhsc participants serve in primary care hpsas 
one year after completion of their nhsc service.  less than half of participants who are still in 
primary care hpsas one year after separation are actually in the same county as the one in 
which they served while in service (i.e., 43% of participants). there is a fairly steep decline in 
the retention rate in years 2 and 3 after separation (by about 10 and 3 percentage points, 
respectively), followed by a lower decline thereafter.

focusing on non-participants, we note that their retention rates in primary care hpsas are 
always higher than the retention rates of participants, both in terms of retention in the same 
hpsa as well as in terms of retention in a different hpsa. their retention also drops after we 
first observe them in the data (their start year).  one year after we first observe non-
participants in hpsas, 94% of them are still in hpsas.  moreover, a very large fraction of them 
(89% of all non-participants) remain in the same hpsas where they were first observed.  the 
retention rates in any hpsas decline by about 3-4 percentage points every year thereafter, 
while the retention rates in the same hpsa decline at a slightly faster rate (about 6-7 
percentage points per year).  these rates indicate that once non-participant providers serve in a 
hpsa, they tend to remain in those areas, and to some extent even when they move, they 
migrate from one hpsa to another. 

in figure es.2 we present the retention rates in mental health hpsas.  the retention rates of 
participants are lower in mental health hpsas than in the case of primary care hpsas.  the 
fraction of participants serving in the same hpsa as during the program drops from 35% in the 
first year to 29% in the second year, and to 27% in the third year since separation. from then on

it hovers between 19% and 24%.  the retention rate of participants in any mental health hpsa 
is relatively constant over the years, ranging between 56% and 67%. 

similar to primary care hpsas, non-participants in mental health hpsas are more likely to stay 
in the same hpsa than participants.  their retention rate declines by 3-4 percentage points 
each year since the start year, while the retention rate in any hpsa declines at a lower rate, 
about 2-3 percentage points. it is important to note that the retention rate in any mental health 
hpsa is similar across participants and non-participants, especially in the further out years.

it is important to note that we dropped from the retention analyses in figures es.1 and es.2 the 
nhsc participants who left service in 2015, which is the last year of our timeframe.   

a comparison with previous retention results 

in the case of primary care providers, the same hpsa retention rates in the first years after 
separation from service are lower than in lewin (2014).  specifically, the retention rates from 
this study are between 6 to 10 percentage points lower than in lewin (2014) for the first years 
since separation, with the difference being larger in the further-out years.  this suggests that the 
primary care providers who left nhsc in the more recent years leave the hpsa where they 
served at higher rates than before.   

however, when comparing the any hpsa retention rates, it turns out that although the 
retention rates from this study are smaller than the ones reported in lewin (2014), the 
differences are much smaller than in the case of same hpsa retention (about 2-3 percentage 
points).  this suggests that nhsc alumni still remain in hpsas at elevated rates (just as 

 

3 

executive summary 

national health service corps  an extended analysis 

documented in lewin 2014), but the moves from the same hpsa to any hpsa locations are 
more frequent in the more recent years than in the past.  

similarly, in the case of mental health providers, the same hpsa retention is smaller than in 
lewin (2014), by values between 2 and 12 percentage points.  the differences in any hpsa 
retention are much smaller (between 1 and 2 percentage points, with one exception).  as in the 
case of primary care providers, this points to: (i) an increase in the frequency with which 
providers move out of the hpsas where they served while in nhsc; and (ii) a large fraction of 
these moves out of same hpsa have as a destination another hpsa, such that the any 
hpsa retention is overall very close to the any hpsa retention from the previous study. 

we develop a theoretical framework in which a zero difference between the retention rates of 
participants and non-participants is equivalent to a zero recruiting effect.  we define the 
recruiting effect as the programs success in attracting providers who would not serve in hpsas 
without the incentive.  since the average hpsa preference for the newly attracted providers is 
lower than the average preference of the rest of the providers, it follows that the post-obligation 
retention rate of participants is lower than that of non-participants.  importantly, the retention 
differential becomes larger when the recruiting effect is larger.   

in lewin (2104), the average retention differential between non-participants and participants 
over the first six years since separation/start year is 11.7 percentage points for primary care 
providers, and 3.3 percentage points for mental health providers.  it turns out that in our study 
the average retention differential over the first six years since separation/start year is 13.6 and 
5.4 percentage points for primary care and mental health providers, respectively.  this increase 
in the retention differential is consistent with an increase in the program recruiting effect.  it is in 
fact possible that the increase in the program generosity and program outreach that were the 
result of the aca and arra changes in the 2009-2011 period resulted in more and more 
providers who would not have served in hpsas in the absence of the nhsc award.  if that were 
the case, then these new program participants had a smaller retention rate, potentially indicating 
that the programs recruiting effect over the last few years may have increased.   

as we show in chapter iv, these differences do not seem to be driven by other provider-level or 
local-level characteristics, such as age, gender, provider type, local area income, or percent of 
the population under poverty rate. 

a comparison with nhsc participants who served in indian health service sites 

in figure es.3 we present the retention profiles in the same hpsa as well as in any hpsa 
using the same methods described above for nhsc participants who served in ihs sites.  
given that ihs sites change their destination somewhat frequently over our timeframe, we 
construct the same hpsa and the any hpsa retention rates by whether the provider was 
ever working in an ihs site, and whether the provider was last observed in service in an ihs site.  
the same hpsa retention rates are similar to the same hpsa retention rates from figure 
es.1 for all nhsc providers.  the retention rate based on whether the provider was ever in an 
ihs site is lower than the retention rate of providers who leave nhsc service from ihs sites.   

despite the fact that the same hpsa retention of the nhsc-ihs providers who were ever in 
an ihs site is lower than that of the nhsc-ihs providers who left service from an ihs site 
(especially for the further out years), the any hpsa retention rates of these categories are 
virtually indistinguishable from each other.  nonetheless, the nhsc-ihs any hpsa retention 
rates are larger than the any hpsa retention rates of all nhsc participants.  there a number 
of limitations that preclude us from making direct comparisons with the any hpsa retention 
rates of all nhsc providers, but this higher retention rate of nhsc-ihs alumni may point to a

executive summary

higher preference for serving ihs site populations, and thus a higher preference for serving in 
nhsc in general.

recruiting and retention effects 

in order to be effective, nhsc must be able to induce some providers to locate in hpsas given 
that they would not have otherwise chosen those locations.  a large number of providers do 
practice in hpsas and do not need an incentive to do so.  however, those who would have 
located in hpsas without the incentive may apply for and receive the incentive if they are 
eligible.  hence, the payment of the incentive to these providers does not increase the supply of 
providers in hpsas.  conversely, some providers who would not have chosen to practice in 
hpsas may be induced to do so by the program.  if so, they increase the supply of providers in 
the area.  this is what we call the recruiting effect of the nhsc program.  a larger recruiting 
effect translates into a greater success of the program, given that the supply of providers in 
hpsas is larger than what it would be in the absence of the program. 

also, the nhsc program generates a retention effect to the extent that nhsc providers serve in 
hpsas longer than what they would if there were no program.  ultimately, this effect is defined 
following the same logic as for the recruiting effect, of whether the program directly increases 
the supply of medical services in hpsas, relative to a case when the program does not exist. 

estimation of the recruiting effect is based on an empirical specification in which the total 
number of providers currently serving in a hpsa is modeled as a function of the number of 
nhsc participating providers serving in that area.  a one-to-one increase in the number of 
providers as a result of nhsc participation is interpreted as evidence that the program attracts 
only providers who would not serve there without the incentive, whereas a zero effect of 

 

5 

executive summary 

national health service corps  an extended analysis 

program participation on providers is interpreted as consistent with the notion that the program 
does not attract any new providers in the areaall would have practiced in the hpsa 
regardless of the incentive.  these are extreme cases, and the reality lies between the two 
bounds, but an estimated effect that is closer to 1 indicates a larger recruiting effect, whereas an 
effect that is closer to 0 indicates a smaller recruiting effect.  in this model we control for past 
levels of providers in the area, as well as for a number of relevant local level characteristics that 
typically influence the location choices of providers. 

regarding the retention effect, we make use of a novel dataset, that of providers who were 
deemed eligible for nhsc funding in the application process, but ended up not receiving 
funding, mainly because of funding limits.  a comparison between the time served in hpsas by 
nhsc participants and the time served in hpsas by non-participating providers may not yield a 
true retention effect of the program, as the two provider populations may be inherently different 
in terms of characteristics we cannot measure in the current data.  the differential retention 
patterns between participants and non-participants may be a combination of the true program 
retention effect and the effect of other, non-program related factors.  given that, arguably, the 
unfunded providers represent a provider population that is similar to that of actually funded 
providers, a comparison between these two categories will mitigate the influence of other 
factors, and help us better isolate the actual retention effect of the program. 

our estimates of recruiting and retention effects indicate substantial increases in the number of 
fte-years generated by nhsc in hpsas.  we estimate that over the entire period considered, 
nhsc increased the number of primary care physician fte-years in hpsas by about 12,500, 
the number of np/pas fte-years by about 35,000 and the number of mental health provider 
fte-years by 28,000. 

in this study we face a number of important data limitations in the estimation of the recruiting 
and retention effects.  hence, our estimates should be viewed with caution.  however, 
regardless of the exact value of the total effect on the number of provider-years in hpsas, our 
estimates presented in chapter vi point to potential important program effects of the nhsc 
program in increasing the number of providers in high-need areasproviders that would not be 
there with the nhsc incentive.  this study advances current knowledge on the nhsc program 
effect, and offers a pathway for further causal effect analyses, once more data on participants 
and eligible unfunded providers becomes available in the future.

introduction 

national health service corps  an extended analysis 

introduction 

in this study we continue our analysis of the national health service corps (nhsc) with the 
purpose of gaining new insights into the programs performance regarding the distribution of 
providers in high-need areas.  the objective of this study is threefold.  first, we focus on the 
recent retention trends of nhsc program alumni in health professional shortage areas 
(hpsas).  second, we analyze the retention patterns of those nhsc participants who serve in 
indian health service (ihs) sites and compare them with that of all nhsc participants, and 
third, we examine the recruiting and retention effects of the program. 

the nhsc is administered by the bureau of health workforce (bhw) in the health resources 
and services administration (hrsa).  its stated goal is to improve the geographic distribution of 
the health care workforce in hpsas by providing financial support to eligible providers who 
serve in those areas. the nhsc funds a loan repayment program (lrp) and a scholarship 
program (sp).  since 2009, the lrps generosity has increased significantly.  in fy 2014, 
providers participating in lrp received up to $30,000 per year for a 2-year commitment (relative 
to typically $25,000 per year in previous years) in a hpsa with scores between 0 and 13, and 
up to $50,000 for a 2-year commitment in a hpsa with scores of 14 or higher. the statute 
allows for up to $35,000 per year (or $70,000 over two years).  upon the conclusion of an initial 
service obligation period, nhsc providers may apply for additional loan repayment funding in 
return for further service.  the scholarship program offers funding for up to four years of 
medical school in exchange for an obligation to serve in a hpsa for a time that is equal to the 
time the provider received the scholarship. 

the nhsc deployed 9,700 health care professionals to thousands of sites across the country in 
2015 (hrsa congressional justification for 2017).1  in the fy 2017 department of health and 
human services (dhhs) budget, president obama proposes boosting the national health 
services corps to 15,000 a year over 2018-2020 (hrsa congressional justification for 2017).  
these clinicians include primary care physicians, primary care nurse practitioners, certified 
nurse-midwives, primary care physician assistants, dentists, registered dental hygienists, health 
service psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, psychiatric nurse specialists, marriage 
and family therapists, and licensed professional counselors.  these professionals deliver critical 
medical, dental, and mental health services in geographic areas, facilities, and populations that 
have limited access to health care services (health resources and services administration, 
2016).  

in a previous project (lewin, 2014), we examined short- and long-term retention in hpsas of 
providers who participated in nhsc lrp and sp and compared their retention with the 
retention of non-participants working in those areas, using data from the period 2000-2013.  in 
the current study we increase the timeframe by adding two more years of nhsc administrative 
data (2014 and 2015) to determine whether the retention patterns changed over the more 
recent years, given the important recent program growth and changes.  we update and expand 
the data infrastructure we constructed for the previous project, and as before, we rely on data 
on nhsc program participants, provider360 data, medicare data and data on hpsa 
designations.  our current nhsc data covers the period between 2000 and 2015, the 
provider360 data is recorded as of january 2015, and the medicare data spans the period 
between 2005 and 2014.2  the provider360 and the medicare data allow us to observe nhsc 
participants and their location after their separation from service.  combining their post-service

2 in lewin (2014), the nhsc data spanned the 2000-2013 period, provider360 was recorded as of december 2013, 

and the medicare data covered the 2005-2011 period.

location with information on whether that location is a hpsa or not, we construct hpsa 
retention statistics for all the program participants that we identified in provider360 or medicare 
data. 

like in the previous study (lewin, 2014), we construct two individual-level analytic datasets.  in 
the first analytic dataset we combine annual, individual-level administrative data on nhsc 
participants with annual, individual-level data from the medicare file.  the main advantage of 
this dataset is that it is longitudinal, thus allowing us to track the location of providers in every 
year of their nhsc obligation, as well as in every year (up to 2014) after separation from 
service.  the second analytic dataset combines administrative nhsc data with individual-level 
data on nhsc alumni as of january 2015.  with this dataset, we are able to analyze the 
retention patterns of nhsc providers by using two points in time: at the time of their service 
separation, and january 2015. 

with these two datasets, we construct descriptive statistics of retention, by calculating the 
retention rates as the fraction of nhsc alumni who still serve in the same hpsa where they 
served while in nhsc, relative to the total number of nhsc providers who left service in that 
hpsa in a given year.  this is what we call same hpsa retention, and we calculate it at 
various points in time after separation from nhsc.  we also construct any hpsa retention 
rates by counting in the numerator  along with the same hpsa providers - all nhsc alumni 
who serve in hpsas other than the hpsa where they served under the nhsc obligation.  
these rates are calculated by provider type, and provider discipline.  we also calculate these 
rates for the nhsc alumni who served in ihs sites. 

an important contribution of this study is that we provide new insights into the recruiting and 
retention effects of the program.  we define the recruiting effect as the success of the program 
in attracting to hpsas providers who would not have served in those areas without the nhsc 
incentive.  it is important to note that this measure is smaller than the number of actual nhsc 
participants, because in reality some nhsc participants would serve in hpsas even if there 
were no program.  our definition of the recruiting effect excludes the latter category, and 
therefore focuses only on the providers who offer services beyond what would be offered in 
hpsas without the nhsc program.  in a similar fashion, we define the retention effect of the 
program as the increase in the number of providers who serve in hpsas longer than they would 
have in the absence of the program. 

estimation of the recruiting effect is based on an empirical specification in which the total 
number of providers currently serving in a hpsa is modeled as a function of the number of 
nhsc participating providers serving in in that area.  a one-to-one increase in the number of 
providers as a result of nhsc participation is interpreted as evidence that the program attracts 
only providers who would not serve there without the incentive, whereas a zero effect of 
program participation on providers is interpreted as consistent with the notion that the program 
does not attract any new providers in the area.  these are extreme cases, and the reality lies 
between the two bounds, but an estimated effect that is closer to 1 indicates a larger recruiting 
effect, whereas an effect that is closer to 0 indicates a smaller recruiting effect.  in this model we 
control for past levels of providers in the area, as well as for a number of relevant local level 
characteristics that typically influence the location choices of providers. 

regarding the retention effect, we make use of a novel dataset, that of providers who were 
deemed eligible for nhsc funding in the application process, but ended up not receiving 
funding, mainly because of funding limits.  a comparison between the time served in hpsas by 
nhsc participants and the time served in hpsas by non-participating providers may not yield a 
true retention effect of the program, as the two provider populations may be inherently different 
in terms of characteristics we cannot account for in the current data.  the differential retention

patterns between participants and non-participants may be a combination of the true program 
retention effect and the effect of other, non-program related factors.  given that, arguably, the 
unfunded providers represent a provider population that is similar to that of actually funded 
providers, a comparison between these two categories will mitigate the influence of other 
factors, and help us better isolate the actual retention effect of the program. 

the main body of the report is organized as follows: in chapter ii we discuss our data sources 
and the construction of the analytical datasets, along with the main measures.  in chapter iii we 
present descriptive statistics of the population of nhsc participants and non-participants, while 
in chapter iv we present the retention rates of nhsc participants, followed by a regression 
analysis in which we attempt to determine how much of the retention differential between nhsc 
alumni and non-participants is explained by program participation, by controlling for a host of 
observable factors, including the providers medical discipline, age and gender as well as other 
factors such as local area median income and percentage of the population in poverty.  in 
chapter v we focus on the retention of nhsc alumni who serve in ihs sites, while in chapter vi 
we present the results from our analysis of the recruiting and retention effects.  chapter vii 
concludes the report, along with a discussion on the key limitations of this study and potential 
future extensions.

data sources and analytic datasets 

we follow the strategy from lewin (2014) to construct two analytic datasets for our empirical 
analyses.  these datasets are constructed by linking administrative information on nhsc 
participants with proprietary and public data on providers that allow us to track nhsc alumni in 
the years after obligation completion.  a detailed description of the data sources, along with a 
discussion on the strategy we used to construct the two analytical datasets is available in lewin 
(2014).  in what follows we review the main features of the various datasets and then focus on 
the new data elements that allow us to update and expand the previous analysis. 

nhsc administrative files and provider datasets 

the nhsc administrative files provided to us by hrsa include all providers who entered the 
nhsc programs over the period 2000-2015.  these files include annually updated, individual 
information on where each participant was located while serving under the nhsc obligation.  of 
the total number of 28,388 providers, 11,868 are physicians, 8,718 are nurse practitioners (np) 
or physician assistants (pa) and the remaining 7,802 individuals represent other providers, such 
as dental or behavioral health providers.  other important individual demographic and 
award/service characteristics, include: age, gender, race/ethnicity, award year, entry year, type 
of award, length of initial service obligation, funds received, practice type, provider type, location, 
and separation year. 

table ii.1 provides relevant statistics about the composition of the nhsc participants in each 
year of the 2000-2015 timeframe.  perhaps the most important feature is the marked increase in 
the number of participants, especially in the more recent years, from a total of 7,080 providers 
participating in the program in 2010, to 10,513 in 2015.  this is not surprising, since these are 
the years when aca and arra stipulations on the number of awards and generosity of awards 
came into effect.  these changes made nhsc very attractive for an increasing number of 
providers. 

more than half of this increase of 3,433 providers is due to an increase in the number of other 
providers participating in the program, about a third due to an increase in nurse practitioners 
and physician assistants (np/pa), and about a sixth due to increases in the number of 
participating physicians.  the fraction of physicians in the total field strength decreased from 
50% in 2010 to 39% in 2015, while the fraction of other providers increased from 21% to 31% 
over the same period.  in terms of nhsc program type, virtually all the increase in field strength 
in the second half of the period is attributable to lrp.  also, female providers represented 74% 
of all participants in 2015 (up from 69% in 2010, and 64% in 2005), while the fraction of white 
providers increased from 54% in 2010 to 68% in 2015.  in appendix table a.1 we present the 
distribution of the nhsc workforce by provider discipline. it is clear that there was a substantial 
increase in the number of mental health providers in the last few years. 

in table ii.2 we present the characteristics of the new providers who join service in every year 
between 2000 and 2015.  focusing on new entrants, one can notice that the number of 
providers starting service in 2010 is almost double the number of new entrants in 2009.  also, 
the new entrants that started service after 2010 were more likely to be white, female, non-
physicians and joining the program through lrp.  these recent flows into the nhsc workforce 
ended up changing the distribution of the nhsc workforce as we show in table ii.1.

the nhsc administrative files do not contain information on the location of providers after 
program completion.  also, they do not contain the participants national provider identification 
(npi) number, or other unique identifiers which would enable us to track their location after 
program completion.  we therefore rely on our additional data sources to identify the 
participants npi and then subsequently determine where they were located after program 
completion.  these data sources, which are also used to identify non-participant providers, are: 
the medicare providers file developed from medicare claims data over the period 2005-2014; 
and the provider 360 file, a proprietary file containing comprehensive information on most 
medical providers in the united states. 

finally, we employ data from hrsa with information on hpsa designations, types, disciplines, 
sites and scores.  we use the most recent file of these data, which was compiled in december 
31, 2013.  the reader is referred to a detailed discussion of these datasets in lewin (2014). 

the medicare provider file contains a total number of providers between 639,197 and 940,690 
in each year of the 2005-2014 period.3  table ii.3 shows the number of providers by type in 
each year.  the data from the 2005-2011 period is the same data as in lewin (2014), whereas

hpsa designations and hpsa scores 

hrsa also provided lewin with a detailed file containing information on all hpsa sites as of 
december 2013.  as of december 2013, there were 5,976 primary care hpsas, 4,758 dental 
care hpsas and 3,876 mental health hpsas.  this file includes information on each hpsa: id, 
name, status, type, discipline, hpsa score and detailed geographic identifiers.  in table ii.4 
below we present the number of hpsa sites by hpsa disciplines (i.e., primary care, dental 
health and mental health) and by the main hpsa types (facility hpsas, single county hpsas, 
census tract hpsas and minor civil division hpsas).5

as most of our empirical analysis was at the zip code level, the next step was to determine 
whether the zip code associated with each providers location was part of a hpsa or not.  we 
used the dataset we received from hrsa containing information on all hpsas and constructed 
an algorithm to determine whether a providers zip code was part of a single-county hpsa, 
census tract hpsa, census division hpsa, or a facility hpsa.  more details are available in 
lewin (2014). 

next, we mapped the detailed health care occupation (available in p360) of each non-nhsc 
participant into the corresponding nhsc discipline.  the list of nhsc disciplines is presented in 
table ii.5 along with the distribution of providers by these disciplines in the overall population of 
nhsc participants and in the sample of participants we identified in the first analytic dataset.  
table ii.5 also provides the average age of providers (at entry in nhsc service) and the 
distribution by gender and hpsa type. 

analytic datasets 

of the total of 28,388 individual nhsc participants we identified a number of 12,903 nhsc 
alumni in the first analytic dataset and a number of 24,173 providers in the second analytic 
dataset.  in the first analytic dataset, 9,435 providers served in primary care hpsas, 2,631 
served in mental care hpsas, and not surprisingly, only 27 served in dental care hpsas.  this 
is because a very small number of dentists and dental workers bill medicare, and thus are not 
captured in the medicare data.  the same limitation applies to ob-gyn physicians and 
pediatricians and other smaller categories of primary care physicians, since they rarely bill 
medicare.  as shown in table ii.5, with the exception of dental care providers, the sample of 
nhsc alumni we identify in the first analytic dataset appears to resemble the overall population 
of participants in terms of provider discipline, age at entry and gender.

we complete the construction of the first analytic dataset by eliminating the following groups of 
non-nhsc participant providers: (i) those who did not fall under any one of the nhsc discipline 
types; (ii) those who did not serve in hpsas; (iii) those who served in hpsas where no nhsc 
participant served over the 2005-2014 period; and (iv) specialists (cardiologists, dermatologists 
etc.).  the purpose of these data restrictions was to ensure a degree of comparability between 
nhsc participants and non-nhsc participants who served in hpsas.  we ended up with a total 
of 289,675 non-participant providers serving in primary care hpsas and a total of 25,324 non-
participants serving in mental health hpsas.  the main characteristics of non-participants are 
presented in table ii.6.

the main advantage of the first analytic dataset stems from the fact that it allows us to track the 
location of providers after they complete their nhsc service.  however, the number of nhsc 
providers is potentially limited.  we therefore constructed a second analytic dataset relying only 
on nhsc data, p360 data and hpsa data.  the main feature of this dataset is that it provides 
information on the nhsc providers location in two points in time: the year of program 
termination and january 2015 (i.e., the time when p360 information is recorded). 

the number of nhsc participants in this second dataset increases to about 24,173.  as 
expected, the distribution of nhsc providers by discipline resembles the distribution from the 
overall nhsc population more closely (table ii.7).  also, the other characteristics of participants 
from the second dataset are more similar to the characteristics from overall population of 
participants.   

                                                

6 this is the average age of non-participant providers when they first appear in the medicare data.

note: the total number of matched nhsc providers presented in the above table is limited to 
providers with a valid npi. 

nhsc-eligible unfunded providers 

a new dataset that was made available for this study by hrsa includes those providers who 
were considered eligible to participate in the program, but ultimately did not receive funding from 
nhsc, largely due to funding limitations.  this category of providers is important, as it 
potentially represents a more adequate comparison group than the non-participating providers 
who serve in hpsas.  non-participating providers are likely to be different from nhsc 
participants across characteristics we cannot account for in the data.  however, if one can 
assume that program participation is in essence randomly distributed across pool of actual 
participants and eligible unfunded providers, then the latter category can serve as a proper 
comparison group and thus offer the possibility to shed more light into the estimation of direct 
program effect on the retention of providers in hpsas. 

there are 1,318 eligible unfunded providers who submitted an nhsc application between 2013 
and 2015.  we exclude from the analysis the 503 providers who applied in 2015, as we are not 
able to track their location in our provider datasets.  in provider360, we identified 166 and 158 
primary care providers who applied in 2013 and 2014, respectively, and 76 and 38 mental 
health providers who applied in 2013 and 2014, respectively.  we track the location of these 
providers for one or two years in provider360.

retention measures 

to analyze retention patterns, as in lewin (2014), we construct four variables: 

  serving in the same hpsa and in the same county.  this variable takes the value of 1 if 

the nhsc provider remains in the same county as the one where he or she served in 
nhsc, and 0 otherwise. 

  serving in a hpsa in another county.  this variable takes the value of 1 if the nhsc 

provider remains in a hpsa that is located in a different county than the one in which he 
or she served while in nhsc service, and 0 otherwise. 

  serving in a non-hpsa from the same county.  this variable takes the value of 1 if the 

nhsc provider moves to a non-hpsa area from the county where he or she served 
while in nhsc, and 0 otherwise. 

  serving in a non-hpsa in another county.  this variable takes the value of 1 if the nhsc 

provider moves to a non-hpsa area from another county than the county he or she 
served while in nhsc, and 0 otherwise. 

we create these measures for non-participants as well, but the reference point is not the year 
when they left service, but the first year (start year) they appear in the medicare data. using 
the above variables, we construct retention rates as the ratios between the number of providers 
in the same (or any) hpsa and the total number of providers leaving service in a given year.  
these rates are calculated one year after separation from nhsc, two years after separation 
from nhsc and so on.  in the case of non-participants the annual retention rates are calculated 
one year since the start year, two years since the start year and so on for each cohort. 

in past literature, retention was approached in multiple ways, with a focus on the length of 
retention in high need areas, the interval at which retention is measured, or defined by the 
locations level of need.  previous retention studies that used retention measures defined by 
these criteria include konrad et al. (2000), holmes (2004), holmes (2005), pathman et al., 
2012(a), pathman et al., 2012(b), or pathman and konrad (2012).

retention of nhsc participants in hpsas 

national health service corps  an extended analysis 

retention of nhsc participants in hpsas 

before we analyze the retention patterns of nhsc participants, it is important to articulate a 
conceptual framework to guide the interpretation of the empirical results. in lewin (2014) we 
constructed a theoretical model of location decisions made by providers.  in this chapter we 
reiterate the main structure and predictions of the model, and then present the retention 
analysis as viewed from the perspective of this model. 

conceptual framework 

in our previous study (lewin, 2014), we specified a theoretical model of geographic location 
choices made by various groups of providers.  in this model, the individual provider is assumed 
to periodically make choices of where to live and practice, guided by which location is offering 
the highest utility.  this utility is a function of: pecuniary factors (compensation package), non-
pecuniary factors (such as preferences for a location type, such as a hpsa); and random 
shocks.  in the simple case of two locations, one being a hpsa, and another one being a non-
hpsa location, the model predicts that the probability of choosing to locate in a hpsa increases 
with the wage differential between the hpsa and non-hpsa locations, as well as with the 
preference differential between the two locations. 

when nhsc is available and all else is constant the probability of an eligible provider to choose 
to locate in a hpsa increases.  more importantly, the nhsc award can attract to hpsas 
providers with a strong distaste (or negative preferences) for hpsas, to the extent that the 
nhsc award may be large enough to compensate for that negative preference.  assuming that 
is the case, the direct implication is that the number of providers who serve in hpsas is most 
likely greater than the number of providers who would serve there had there been no program.  
these additional providers who are directly induced by the program to locate in hpsas reflect a 
recruiting effect of the program. 

if the program generates a recruiting effect as we define it above, it must follow that the average 
preference for a hpsa location in the population of nhsc participants is lower than in the 
population of non-participants who serve in hpsas.  this is driven by the additional providers 
who serve in hpsas despite the fact that they dislike those locations, and do so only as a result 
of the program award.  also, those providers who serve in hpsas without being nhsc 
participants must have sufficiently high preferences for hpsa locations since they do not need 
any additional incentive to serve there.7   

the difference in the average preference for hpsas between the participants and non-
participants has a direct impact on the hpsa retention rate.  as participants have a lower 
average preference, they are less likely to remain in hpsas after they complete their nhsc 
obligation.  in contrast, non-participating providers are more likely to remain in hpsas over time, 
since they serve there in the first place, without the added incentive of the program.  therefore, 
the post-obligation retention rates of participants will be lower than those of non-participants.   

in the case when the hpsa retention of the two provider groups is exactly the same, it must be 
because there is no difference between the participants average hpsa preference the non-
participants average hpsa preference.  this in turn, would reflect that the program was not 
successful in attracting additional providers, i.e., providers who would not locate in hpsas 
without the incentive.  in other words, the recruiting effect of the program would be zero, and all 
participants are simply providers who would have served in hpsas without the program.  in this 

                                                

7 of course, an implicit assumption is that the wages of participants and non-participants serving in hpsas are the 

same.   

 

13 

retention of nhsc participants in hpsas

case, the program award is a payment that does not change the behavior of participants in a 
desired way.  on the contrary, when a large difference in the hpsa retention rates is reflected, 
in light of our conceptual framework, it is consistent with a large recruiting effect of the program, 
and thus points to the programs success in attracting new providers to serve in hpsas. 

we also define a program retention effect as the increase in time served in hpsas by providers 
beyond what would be supplied in the absence of the program.  in other words, the program has 
a retention effect if the average time spent in hpsas by providers is larger than what they would 
have spent had there been no program. 

retention measures using longitudinal data (first analytic dataset) 

in figure iii.1 we start with retention rates in primary care hpsas by years elapsed since 
separation from service (for participants) and by years since start year (for non-participants). 

using data from the first analytic dataset, we find that about 79% of the nhsc participants 
serve in primary care hpsas one year after completion of their nhsc service.  less than half of 
participants who are still in primary care hpsas one year after separation are actually in the 
same county as the one in which they served while in service (i.e., 43% of participants). there is 
a fairly steep decline in the retention rate in years 2 and 3 after separation (by about 10 and 3 
percentage points, respectively), followed by a lower decline thereafter.

focusing on non-participants, we note that their retention rates in primary care hpsas are 
always higher than the retention rates of participants, both in terms of retention in the same 
hpsa as well as in terms of retention in a different hpsa. their retention also drops after we 
first observe them in the data (their start year).  one year after we first observe non-

participants in hpsas, 94% of them are still in hpsas.  moreover, a very large fraction of them 
(89% of all non-participants) remain in the same hpsas where they were first observed.  the 
retention rates in any hpsas decline by about 3-4 percentage points every year thereafter, 
while the retention rates in the same hpsa decline at a slightly faster rate (about 6-7 
percentage points per year).  these rates indicate that once non-participant providers serve in a 
hpsa, they tend to remain in those areas, and to some extent even when they move, they 
migrate from one hpsa to another. 

in figure iii.2 we present the retention rates in mental health hpsas.  the retention rates of 
participants are lower in mental health hpsas than in the case of primary care hpsas.  the 
fraction of participants serving in the same hpsa as during the program drops from 35% in the 
first year to 29% in the second year, and to 27% in the third year since separation. from then on 
it hovers between value of 19% and 24%.  the retention rate of participants in any mental 
health hpsa is relatively constant over the years, ranging between 56% and 67%. 

similar to primary care hpsas, non-participants in mental health hpsas are more likely to stay 
in the same hpsa than participants.  their retention rate declines by 3-4 percentage points 
each year since the start year, while the retention rate in any hpsa declines at a lower rate, 
about 2-3 percentage points. it is important to note that the retention rate in any mental health 
hpsa is similar across participants and non-participants, especially in the further out years.

it is important to note that we dropped from the retention analyses in figures iii.1 and iii.2 the

retention measures using the second analytic dataset 

so far, we have discussed retention statistics using only the first analytic dataset, which is 
based on nhsc, medicare and p360 data.  while this analytic dataset is very useful in that it 
tracks the participants and non-participants location over time, the number of participants 
identified in this dataset may be arguably viewed as small (around 12,093 providers of the total 
of 28,388).  we address this issue by presenting in tables iii.1-iii.3 the retention rates of nhsc 
participants using the second analytic dataset.  however, we can only construct retention rates 
as of january 2015, the time when the p360 data was last available to us. we ended up using a 
number of 16,963 participants for the retention analyses we present below. 

the rates in tables iii.1-iii.3 indicate the fraction of participants who remain in the same hpsa 
or any hpsa between the time of service completion and january 2015.  as a result, the 
fraction remaining in hpsas for the cohort of providers exiting nhsc in 2014 represents a 1-
year retention rate, for those exiting in 2013 it is a 2-year rate and so on.  although the rates in 
table iii.1 are not directly comparable to the rates plotted in figure iii.1, they nonetheless paint 
a similar picture regarding the retention of participants in hpsas after service completion.  

given that the retention rates in tables iii.1-iii.3 are inherently cohort-specific, we constructed 
cohort-specific retention rates using the first analytic dataset (tables a.2 and a.3 in the 
appendix). tables a.2 and a.3 allow for a direct comparison between the retention rates from 
the first analytic dataset and the retention rates from the second analytic dataset (in tables iii.1 
and iii.2).  as the retention rates from the first analytic dataset are virtually indistinguishable 
from the retention rates from the second analytic dataset, we conclude that the first dataset 
provides a comprehensive and representative picture of the entire sample of nhsc participants. 

another advantage of the second analytic dataset was that it allowed us to construct retention 
rates for providers in dental health hpsas.  these rates could not have been constructed with 
data from the first analytic dataset, as the sample size of dental health providers billing 
medicare was extremely small.  as can be noticed in table iii.3, the retention rates of dental 
health participants were similar to the retention rates of providers in primary care and mental 
health hpsas.

finally, tables a.4 and a.5 in the appendix show no substantial variation in the retention rates 
of providers by provider type.  primary care participants are slightly more likely to stay in the 

 

19 

retention of nhsc participants in hpsas 

national health service corps  an extended analysis 

same hpsa same county and less likely to stay in hpsas in other counties than np/pas, while 
mental health physicians are in general less likely than np/pas to remain in hpsas.  we return 
to this issue in chapter iv to determine whether differences in retention rates remain after we 
adjust for the providers age, gender and other individual level and local area characteristics. 

a comparison with previous retention results 

in lewin (2014), the retention rates are shorter, given the shorter timeframe (up to six years 
using the first analytic dataset).  for the years since separation that overlap with those available 
in lewin (2014), we can compare the retention rates directly.   

in the case of primary care providers, the same hpsa retention rates in the first years after 
separation from service are lower than in the previous study.  specifically, the retention rates 
from this study are between 6 to 10 percentage points lower than in lewin (2014) for the first 
years since separation, with the difference being larger in the further-out years.  this suggests 
that the primary care providers who left nhsc in the more recent years leave the hpsa where 
they served at higher rates than before.   

however, when comparing the any hpsa retention rates, it turns out that although the 
retention rates from this study are smaller than the ones reported in lewin (2014), the 
differences are much smaller than in the case of same hpsa retention (about 2-3 percentage 
points).  this suggests that nhsc alumni still remain in hpsa at elevated rates (just as 
documented in lewin 2014), but the moves from the same hpsa to any hpsa locations are 
more frequent in the recent years than in the past.  

similarly, in the case of mental health providers, the same hpsa retention is smaller than in 
lewin (2014), by values between 2 and 12 percentage points.  the differences in any hpsa 
retention are much smaller (between 1 and 2 percentage points, with one exception).  as in the 
case of primary care providers, this points to: (i) an increase in the frequency with which 
providers move out of the hpsas where they served while in nhsc; and (ii) a large fraction of 
these moves out of same hpsa have as a destination another hpsa, such that the any 
hpsa retention is overall very close to the any hpsa retention from the previous study. 

as we explain above, in our theoretical framework a zero difference between the retention rates 
participants and non-participants is equivalent to a zero recruiting effect.  when the program is 
successful in attracting providers who would not serve in hpsas without the incentive, then the 
program has a recruiting effect, and since the average hpsa preference for the newly attracted 
providers is lower than the average preference of the rest of the providers, it follows that the 
post-obligation retention rate of participants is lower than that of non-participants.  importantly, 
the retention differential becomes larger when the recruiting effect is larger.   

in lewin (2104), the average retention differential between non-participants and participants 
over the first six years since separation/start year is 11.7 percentage points for primary care 
providers, and 3.3 percentage points for mental health providers.  it turns out that in this study 
the average retention differential over the first six years since separation/start year is 13.6 and 
5.4 percentage points for primary care and mental health providers, respectively.  this increase 
in the retention differential is consistent with an increase in the program recruiting effect.  it is in 
fact possible that the increase in the program generosity and program outreach that were an 
outgrowth of the aca and arra changes in the 2009-2011 period resulted in more and more 
providers who would not have served in hpsas in the absence of the nhsc award.  if that were 
the case, then these new program participants had a smaller retention rate, potentially indicating 
that the programs recruiting effect over the last few years has increased.

retention of participants by place of nhsc service 

we also analyze the retention patterns of nhsc providers by the place of service to understand 
whether the institution type they work in is associated with their propensity to remain in hpsas 
after service completion. 

in table iii.4 we investigate the retention of providers by whether they were working in a 
federally qualified health center (fqhc) at the time of nhsc completion.  using the first 
analytic dataset, we construct the same hpsa and any hpsa retention rates for the 
participants who leave service from a fqhc and compare them with all nhsc alumnis rates.

as shown in table iii.4, providers who serve in fqhcs are virtually across the board more likely 
to serve in hpsas after they complete their nhsc obligation.  this may potentially indicate that 
providers who find employment in fqhcs are typically more inclined to serve the populations 
that seek medical services at fqhcs.  if the retention rates in table iii.4 represent any 
indication that the fqhc participants have a higher preference for serving in hpsas, it may 
also be the case that a number of these providers would have gone to hpsas even in the 
absence of the nhsc award.

determinants of provider retention in hpsas 

next, we attempt to determine how much of the retention differential between participants and 
non-participants is due to the program, and how much due to other characteristics. 

econometric model 

for this purpose, we used the data on nhsc participants and the data on non-participants from 
the first analytic dataset to estimate regression models in which we control for observable 
characteristics on each individual (), local area characteristics () and an indicator for 
program participation (

) 

 =    + 

   + 

   +  

(1) 

we estimated model (1) by using the same hpsa and the any hpsa indicator variables as 
the dependent variable, respectively.  the coefficient of interest, , indicates the impact of 
nhsc program participation on the number of years served in a hpsa. the 
individual-level characteristics like age, gender and provider type, while the 
census division indicator variables and local area characteristics (at the zip code level), such as: 
family income, poverty rate, percent white, percent black, fraction of the population over 25 with 
a high school degree and percent of the population over the age of 65.  these variables helped 
control for factors that retain or induce providers to leave from their initial place of service.

main results 

as in lewin (2014), we estimated model (1) using a logit specification, separately for primary 
care and mental health hpsas, and by using the same hpsa and the any hpsa indicators 
as dependent variables.  the coefficient estimates are shown in tables iv.1-iv.4.  in each of 
these tables we present 10 models, one for each year elapsed since separation or start year. 

in all models of table iv.1 we estimate a lower probability of remaining in the same primary 
care hpsa for participants relative to non-participants.  female providers were slightly less 
likely to remain in hpsas, and older providers were more likely to remain in the same hpsa 
over time.  we detect no systematic differences by provider type.  providers leaving service or 
appearing for the first time in the data in the earlier years (2005 or 2006) had a higher 
probability of remaining in the same hpsa relative to those whose separation/start year 
occurred later. it is important to note that the coefficient estimates on the local area 
characteristics are in many cases statistically significant, indicating that providers are more likely 
to remain in hpsas where the poverty rate is higher, the fraction of older population is higher 
and the ratio of individuals over the age of 25 with a high school degree is lower.8  

the first year of the analytic dataset was 2005 for non-participants. we coded the start year 
variable to take the value of 1 for all non-participants, although some of them may have been in 
their locations for longer periods.  we did not detect any differences in the main regression 
coefficients if we included only providers of ages that are similar to the age of participants. 

                                                

8in tables iv.1-iv.4, we report in parentheses robust standard errors, clustered by hpsa.  the base 
group is defined as providers who are: male, age 26-35, non-physician and non-np/pa, having a start 
year of 2012 or later, and serving in the northeast.  the coefficient on any of the dummy variables 
included in these models shows the estimated difference relative to the corresponding excluded category.  
we do not report the intercept and the coefficients on the census division dummies for reasons of space.

estimating model (1) with the any hpsa indicator as the dependent variable, we found very 
similar patterns in the retention of providers in primary care hpsas (table iv.2). the main 
difference is that the coefficients on family income variable become statistically significant and 
negative, indicating that providers are less likely to stay in hpsas where the average family

income is increasing.  along with the estimates on the other local area characteristics (that are 
directionally similar to the estimates from table iv.1), these findings are in line with our 
hypothesis that providers serving in hpsas have a preference to serve underserved 
populations. 

in the case of mental health hpsas, male and female providers did not differ in their retention 
probability in the same hpsa (table iv.3).  similar to primary care providers, the older the 
providers the more likely they were to remain in the same mental health hpsa.  also, providers 
with a separation/start year at the beginning of our timeframe were in general more likely to 
remain in the same hpsa.  in terms of differences in retention relative to primary care hpsas, 
we estimated a lower probability to remain in the same mental health hpsa for medical doctors 
and nurse practitioners relative to other mental health workers, with the effect being stronger in 
the further out separation/start years.  we also estimated more variation in same hpsa 
retention by census divisions.  providers in the east south central and south atlantic divisions 
were least likely to remain in the same mental health hpsa.  finally, although the estimates on 
poverty rate and percent of people over 25 who are high school graduates are directionally the 
same as in the case of primary care models, we found that a higher proportion of blacks at the 
local level increases the retention probability of mental health providers. 

as shown in table iv.4, the difference in retention between participants and non-participants 
disappeared in the case of mental health same hpsa.  other important features in table iv.4 
are that the differences in retention by age group, provider type, separation/start year and 
census division were less pronounced or virtually non-existent, while the differences by local 
area characteristics are similar to those from table iv.3. 

marginal effects 

the coefficients in tables iv.1-iv.4 are logit coefficients and hence do not provide a direct 
indication of the magnitude of the effect of various characteristics on the average retention 
probability of providers in hpsas.  we therefore calculate marginal effects, which show the 
ceteris paribus differences in retention probability (measured in percentage points) relative to 
the mean retention probability.   

in figure iv.1 we present the marginal effects associated with nhsc participation for primary 
care hpsas (same hpsa and any hpsa, respectively). in the first year since separation/start 
year, nhsc participants are 39.2 percentage points less likely to remain in the same hpsa 
relative to non-participants.  this difference represents a regression-adjusted difference, 
obtained by netting out the impact of other (observable) individual socio-demographic and local 
area characteristics.  given that the unadjusted difference in the retention rate in the same 
hpsa in the first separation/start year is 46.6 percentage points (=89.5-43.0, from figure iii.1), 
it follows that 84% (=39.2/46.6) of the observed difference in primary care same hpsa 
retention is explained by nhsc participation.  almost all of the observed retention difference, 
85.6% (=15.3/15.5), is explained by nhsc participation in the case of primary care any hpsa 
in the first separation/start year.  the other ratios between adjusted and unadjusted retention 
differences in retention between participants and non-participants remained about the same for 
the other further out separation/start years, for both primary care same hpsa and any hpsa 
measures.

figure iv.2 presents the regression-adjusted retention differentials by nhsc participation for 
mental health hpsas.  the retention differentials are lower across the board for the same 
hpsa measure than in the case of primary care hpsas.  for the any hpsa measure the 
differences in retention between participants and non-participants were practically zero, as 
shown by the statistically insignificant coefficients in table iv.2.

as shown in figure iii.2, the unadjusted retention in any hpsa was higher for non-participants 
in the first separation/start years than that of participants.  nonetheless, after accounting for 
individual-level and local area characteristics, there was no statistically significant difference 
between the retention of participants and non-participants in mental health hpsas in any of the 
separation/start years.   

overall, for the same number of years since separation (i.e., 1 to 6), the estimates in figures 
iv.1 and iv.2 are similar to the corresponding estimates from lewin (2014).  for the further out 
years, we estimate that the retention differential explained by nhsc participation increases.  
this is not necessarily surprising, as it mirrors the unadjusted differences between participants 
and non-participants from figures iii.1 and iii.2.  although we estimate that the earlier nhsc 
entrants  which are in essence the providers observed 7 to 10 years after service - tend to stay 
longer in hpsas than the more recent entrants (as shown in tables iv.1-iv.4), it is the flatter 
retention rate of non-participating providers 7 to 10 years since their start year that is driving 
these larger differences in the further out years.  in other words, after 7 years non-participants 
tend to leave hpsas at lower rates than participants. 

multinomial logit models 

a more complex model to estimate the providers probability to move over the observed period 
is the multinomial logit.  the advantage of this model is that it simultaneously considers the 

 

29 

retention of nhsc participants in hpsas 

national health service corps  an extended analysis 

entire locations choice set available to providers in each year.  specifically, after controlling for 
the same characteristics from above, this model provides estimates of the probability of each of 
four mutually exclusive outcomes: (1) the probability of choosing to remain in the same hpsa 
and same county; (2) the probability of moving to a non-hpsa location within the same county; 
(3) the probability to move to another hpsa in another county; and (4) the probability of moving 
to a non-hpsa in another county. 

inclusion of the nhsc participation variable in the multinomial logit model allows for the 
estimation of the difference in migration probabilities between participants and non-participants 
to any of the four hpsa/non-hpsa type locations.  in figure iv.3 we present the marginal 
effects associated with these migration probability differences for primary care hpsas, while in 
figure iv.4 we present the marginal effects for mental health hpsas.  we do not present the 
actual coefficients from the multinomial logit models for space considerations.

according to our estimates, participants serving in primary care hpsas are 38.6% less likely 
than non-participants to remain in the same hpsa in the first separation/start year.  at the same 
time, they are 25.9 % more likely to move to a hpsa in another county in the first 
separation/start year, meaning that overall, they are 12.7 percentage points (=-38.6+25.9) less 
likely to remain in any primary care hpsa.  the same hpsa and any hpsa estimates from 
figure iv.3 are in line with our estimate from figure iv.1, but the advantage of the multinomial 
logit model is that it also shows that participants are 5.4% more likely than non-participants to 
move to non-hpsas in the same county and 7.2% to move to non-hpsas in another county.

in addition, as in lewin (2014), the multinomial logit estimates explain why the mental health 
participants show no difference in their any hpsa retention relative to non-participants.  as 
shown in figure iv.4, in the first separation/start year participants are 26.7% less likely to 
remain in the same county same hpsa than non-participants, but 27.4% more likely to move to 
hpsas in another county.  when these differences are added up they yield an estimate of 
virtually zero difference between participants and non-participants in terms of retention in any 
mental health hpsa. 

comparing these findings with the ones from lewin (2014), we find that there a lot of similarities 
in terms of the magnitude and sign of the estimates.  we nonetheless find that the probabilities 
to move out of same hpsa and move into other hpsas from this study are a few 
percentage points larger than the ones from lewin (2014).  as we discuss when we present 
figures iv.1 and iv.2 above, these results are consistent with the finding that more recent 
participants have more frequent moves out of the same hpsa and into any hpsas.  overall, 
any hpsa retention remains about the same as in lewin (2014). 

viewed from the perspective of our conceptual framework, the empirical estimates from this 
chapter provide strong evidence that participation in the nhsc programs is not entirely based 
on selection by preferences.  in other words, nhsc has a recruiting effect, as it is able to attract 
in hpsas providers who would not serve there without the program award.  we return to the 
estimation of the recruiting effect in chapter vi.  it follows that the nhsc has a bigger effect on 

 

31 

retention of nhsc participants in hpsas 

national health service corps  an extended analysis 

person-years of service in hpsas than in a case when selection into the program is based only 
on preferences (and as a result there are no differences in retention between participants and 
non-participants).  furthermore, another implication is that a larger difference between the 
retention in a hpsa of nhsc participants and non-participants is a sign of program success, 
not failure.  in fact, in chapter vi we present estimates showing that despite the lower retention 
of nhsc participants in hpsa relative to non-participants, the program has a recruiting and a 
retention effect that ultimately yield substantial increases in the total number of fte-years in 
hpsas.

retention of nhsc participants serving in indian health

in this chapter we provide a similar analysis focused on nhsc participants who served in indian 
health sites (in short, nhsc-ihs providers).  we start by showing in table v.1 a number of 
relevant descriptive statistics on the population of nhsc-ihs providers. 

we identify in the nhsc administrative data a number of 970 nhsc-ihs providers, of which 
520 were classified under primary care, 234 under mental care and 216 under dental care.  
we find in the first analytic dataset a number of 405 such providers, and 773 of them in the 
second analytic dataset.

using the first analytic dataset, we construct the retention profiles in the same hpsa as well as 
in any hpsa using the same methods described in chapter iii.  we present these retention 
rates in figure v.1.  given that ihs sites change their destination fairly frequently over our 
timeframe, we construct the same hpsa and the any hpsa retention rates by whether the 
provider was ever working in an ihs site, and whether the provider was last observed in service 
in an ihs site. 

as shown in figure v.1, the same hpsa retention rates are similar to the same hpsa 
retention rates from figure iii.1 for all nhsc providers.  the retention rate based on whether 

 

33 

recruiting and retention effects 

national health service corps  an extended analysis 

the provider was ever in an ihs is lower than the retention rate of providers who leave nhsc 
service from ihs sites.   

despite the fact that the same hpsa retention of the nhsc-ihs providers who were ever in 
an ihs site is lower than that of the nhsc-ihs providers who left service from an ihs site 
(especially for the further out years), the any hpsa retention rates of these categories are 
virtually indistinguishable from each other. 

nonetheless, the nhsc-ihs any hpsa retention rates are larger than the any hpsa 
retention rates of all nhsc participants.  there a number of limitations that preclude us from 
making direct comparisons with the any hpsa retention rates of all nhsc providers, but this 
higher retention rate of nhsc-ihs alumni may point to a higher preference for serving ihs site 
populations, and thus a higher preference for serving in nhsc in general.

the main limitation in the retention analysis of nhsc-ihs participants comes from the fact that 
many of the nhsc-ihs participants are likely to be participants in the ihss own loan repayment 
program.  if that is the case, we cannot distinguish between nhsc-ihs participants and the 
nhsc-ihs participants who also have an ihs loan repayment.  their retention rates may be 
different from each other, and what we observe in figure v.1 is a combination of these retention 
rates.  because of this data limitation, we cannot construct retention profiles of non-nhsc 
providers who serve in ihs sites, as they may be in fact ihs loan repayment participants. 

in tables v.2-v.4 we present retention rates that we calculate using the second analytic dataset.  
as in the case of all nhsc participants, the retention rates from those tables paint a similar 
picture as figure v.1.  however, the sample sizes in the year-hpsa cells are sometimes very 

 

34 

recruiting and retention effects

small, such that some of the yearly retention rates are less reliable.  in fact we exclude the rows 
where the number of nhsc-ihs participants is very low.

nhsc recruiting and retention effects 

in this chapter we provide a more in-depth analysis of the nhscs recruiting and retention 
effects.   

recruiting effect 

in order to be effective, nhsc must be able to induce some providers to locate in hpsas given 
that they would not have otherwise chosen those locations.  as documented by the medicare 
provider data, a large number of providers do practice in hpsas and do not need an incentive 
to do so.  however, those who would have located in hpsas without the incentive may apply for 
and receive the incentive if they are eligible.  it follows that the program award to these 
participants are unnecessary payments (or economic rent, as it is typically referred to in the 
economics literature) in the sense that the decision of these providers to locate and serve in a 
hpsa is not influenced by the program.  hence, the payment of the incentive to these providers 
does not increase the supply of providers in hpsas.  conversely, some providers who would 
not have chosen to practice in hpsas may be induced to do so by the program.  if so, they 
increase the supply of providers in the area.  this is what we call the recruiting effect of the 
nhsc program.  a larger recruiting effect translates into a greater success of the program, 
given that the supply of providers (and ultimately, the volume of medical services provided) in 
hpsas is larger than what it would be in the absence of the program. 

econometric model 

to estimate the recruiting effect of the program we consider an econometric model that uses 
information on the number of providers and program participants at the county-year level over 
the period between 2005 and 2014, available in the first analytic dataset.  let    be the number 
of providers in county i and year t.  we can then write: 

                                                     =    +    +                                         (2) 
where  is a vector of characteristics of county i in year t,  is a vector of coefficients, and  
is a random error term.  the characteristics in  are intended to capture factors that determine 
providers to choose one location over another, such as local socio-economic and demographic 
county-level characteristics, while  denotes the number of nhsc program participants in 
county i in year t.  since both the dependent variable and the counts of participating providers 
represent stock measures (i.e., the result of inflows and outflows of providers in a given year 
and in a given county, plus those who stay in the area from one year to the next), we include 
two lagged terms of the number of providers.   

the strategy associated with the model is to predict the number of providers of the relevant type 
in a county (both hpsa and non-hpsa) as a function of factors that may be associated with the 
propensity of providers to locate in that area.  these factors include the size, age and sex 
distribution of the population; the socio-economic characteristics of the population, including 
median income, and percent below poverty; distribution of the population by type of insurance 
(medicare, medicaid, commercial, other); and other measurable factors that may be related to 
the attractiveness of the area as a place to practice.  the model can be estimated by including 
only the counties where at least one nhsc participant is observed over the entire timeframe, or 
by including all counties (with and without nhsc participants).  of course, the nhsc recruiting 
effect is determined only using data from counties with nhsc participants, and its magnitude 
should not differ across the two data samples. 

 

37 

recruiting and retention effects 

national health service corps  an extended analysis 

program participants in a county may or may not add to the number of providers in a hpsa.  if 
the program participants would have practiced in that hpsa anyway, without the incentive of the 
program, they would not add to the expected number of providers.  however, if because of the 
programs incentives, there are more providers in the targeted area than would be expected 
otherwise, then the program has been successful in adding to providers in that hpsa.    

the model in equation (2) estimates the  parameter on  that indicates whether the increase 
in the number of providers in hpsas is between 0 and 1.  if the estimated value of  is zero, the 
program does not add to the number of providers.  if the value is one, each program participant 
adds to the number of providers in hpsas, and as such all participants have been induced by 
the program to serve in hpsas.  in other words, the program does not pay any economic rent 
to its participants.  if instead the value of the coefficient is zero, then the program only pays 
economic rent, that is, all program participants would have served in hpsas even without the 
incentive.  one minus the estimate of  indicates the proportion of participants that would have 
practiced in the targeted areas without the incentive, while the estimate of  shows the fraction 
of participating providers that were attracted to hpsas and who would not have otherwise 
practiced in hpsas.   

empirical estimates 

in table vi.1 we present the regression coefficients obtained by estimating the model in 
equation (2) for primary care physicians and np/pas.  in the case of physicians, we estimate 
that for every 10 primary care nhsc participants, the number of primary care physicians in a 
hpsa increases by 4.31.  this finding is consistent with an important recruiting effect, since it 
indicates that nhsc participation does increase the number of primary care physicians in 
hpsas.  in the case of non-physician primary care providers, we find that almost 8 out 10 new 
nhsc entrants are providers who would not have served in hpsas in the absence of the 
program.   

the larger effect for non-physicians may suggest that the nhsc award represents a much 
larger fraction in the total income of these providers than it is the case for physicians.  in this 
sense, the nhsc program may be a relatively more attractive option for nps and pas, as the 
actual award amounts may be more successful in compensating these providers for the 
negative hpsa preference they may have. 

we also estimate model (2) using the counts of mental health providers and found an effect of 
0.594 on nhsc participation, at the same level of statistical significance.

  note: the models include state and year dummies.  standard errors are shown in parentheses. 
* p<0.10, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01. 

the other variables we included in these models are intended to capture other factors 
that are typically correlated with providers decisions to locate in various areas.  similar to 
other findings in the literature, we estimate that providers are more numerous in counties 
where the median family income is larger, the percent of white is larger (in the case of 
physicians), and the poverty rate is higher (in the case of nps and pas, and mental 
health providers).  rickets and randolph (2014) find that physicians move to places 
lower provider-to-population ratios, but with a higher per capita income and lower 
unemployment. 

 

39 

recruiting and retention effects 

national health service corps  an extended analysis 

as a robustness check, we estimate the two models from table vi.1 including only 
observations from the counties in which there were nhsc participants.  as expected, the 
magnitude of the nhsc estimates remains the same; we take this as an additional 
confirmation that the estimated effect is unlikely to be generated by other non-nhsc 
factors. 

we also estimate models in which we restrict the data to exclude the recent years, to 
determine whether the recruiting effect has changed over time.  in models in which we 
only include data through 2012, 2013 and 2014 we estimate an effect of 0.415, 0.375, 
and 0.350 (each highly statistically significant) respectively, for primary care physicians.  
while these estimates may not suggest much change for primary care physicians, for 
np/pas we estimate effects of 0.373 and 0.257 (with p-values lower than 0.001) when we 
restrict the data to include only the years through 2010 and 2011, respectively.  including 
the more recent years the effect on np/pas is basically the same as the one reported in 
the second column of table v.1.  similarly, in the case of mental health providers, we 
obtain nhsc estimates of 0.104 and 0.076 (statistically significant at 1%).  the increase 
in the estimated recruiting effect on non-physicians (nps, pas and mental health 
providers) coincides with the aca and arra changes. 

retention effect 

as we discuss in chapter iii, the nhsc program generates a retention effect to the extent that 
nhsc providers serve in hpsas longer than what they would if there were no program.  
ultimately, this effect is defined following the same logic as in the case of the recruiting effect, of 
whether the program directly increases the supply of medical services in hpsas, relative to a 
case when the program does not exist. 

however, it is difficult to gain insights into a counterfactual scenario in which the program is 
inexistent.  the readily available comparison group - that of non-participating providers -, may 
be very different in terms of unobservable characteristics from the group of participating 
providers.  in turn, these unobservable differences may affect the time spent in hpsas by the 
two groups (regardless of the nhsc program), and as such, the comparison between the 
retention of participants and the retention of non-participants as we present it in chapters iii and 
iv may not be reflective of a true program retention effect. 

ideally, one would need an experimental setting (or a randomized control trial) in which nhsc 
participation is randomly allocated to a population of providers.  this would ensure that the 
population of participants and non-participants is similar across all relevant characteristics, and 
hence, a comparison between the retention of participants and the retention of non-participants 
would be enough to isolate the program impact on provider retention in hpsas.  the more 
adequate comparison group we identified for this study is the group of providers who are eligible 
for nhsc service, but did not receive funding.  assuming that the main reason they were 
unfunded was funding limitations, this group is directly comparable to the group of participants. 

in table vi.2 we present the retention rates of the primary care unfunded eligible providers who 
submitted an application in 2013 and 2014.  these rates are constructed using the second 
analytic dataset because these individuals are only out of service for a maximum of two years in 
january 2015, and because we wanted to include as many eligible unfunded providers as 
possible in this analysis.  using the retention rates of those who are in any hpsa in the 
application year, we construct an expected (or average) time spent in hpsas by these 
providers.  our calculations indicate that over the maximum period of two years of observation 
afforded by our data, eligible unfunded providers spend on average 1.8 years in hpsas.  we 

 

40 

recruiting and retention effects 

national health service corps  an extended analysis 

then compare this time with the time that actual participants spend in hpsas over the first two 
years elapsed since their application - which in the vast majority of cases is practically two 
years, as attrition while in service is very low - it turns out that the nhsc program increases 
retention in hpsas by about 10% (=(2/1.8)-1).  this is an estimate of the retention effect of the 
program over the two years elapsed since the application.   

inherent data limitations (i.e., the data on the eligible unfunded applicants does not goes back 
further than 2013) do not allow us to construct a more general estimate of the retention effect, 
over a large period of time since nhsc application.

the rates in tables vi.2 and vi.3 are unadjusted differences, that is, they are obtained without 
controlling for the various local-level and individual level characteristics we use above.  this is 
because of the severe limitations of the sample sizes.  nonetheless, it may be reasonable to 
assume that, as we see in our regression models from this and the previous chapter, variables 
like age, gender, provider type and other characteristics do not appear to explain much from the 
differences between the various provider groups. 

it is important to note that a large fraction of the unfunded providers who applied from a non-
hpsa location did move to a hpsa one or two years after the application.  from the viewpoint 
of our conceptual framework, these are potentially providers who would have moved to hpsa 
even without the incentive offered through the program.  it is remarkable that the fraction of 

 

41 

recruiting and retention effects 

national health service corps  an extended analysis 

providers who applied from a non-hpsa location and did not move to a hpsa varies between 
30 and 40%, very similar to the recruiting effect estimates from the previous section.   

total effect of the nhsc program 

in the previous sections of this chapter, we estimate of: (1) the number of additional providers 
who serve in hpsas as the result of nhsc; and (2) the increase in retention in hpsas due to 
the incentive.  we now translate these effects into the number of annual provider ftes 
generated by the program, and for each provider type considered. 

the full effect of an incentive program, expressed as the total provider fte-years generated by 
the program, , is obtained using the following expression: 

                                                    =    +   (,  ,)                                  (3) 

the first term in equation (3) calculates the number of additional fte-years coming from the 
providers induced by the program, , and is obtained by multiplying  with the expected 
years these additional providers serve in hpsas, .  the product between  and  
represents the recruiting effect of the program and it reflects the number of annual provider 
ftes generated by the program by attracting into hpsas providers who would not have served 
there in the absence of the program.  the term  is computed using the retention profiles of the 
additional providers.  the retention profile of these additional providers is inferred from the 
retention rates of program participants, the retention rates of non-participants (as reported in 
figures iii.1-iii.4), and the recruiting effect estimates from table vi.1.  in the upper part of table 
vi.4 we report these inferred retention rates for each of the three groups of providers considered.   

the second term in equation (3) measures the retention effect of the program in terms of the 
annual provider ftes in hpsas, by multiplying the number of program participants, , with the 
difference in the average time spent in hpsas by program participants and comparable, non-
participating providers (i.e., the unfunded eligible providers), ,  ,.  if the average time in 
hpsas of program participants, ,, is larger than the average time in hpsas of non-
participants, ,, then the program has a retention effect.  the term  indicates all program 
participants, including both providers attracted by the program as well as providers who would 
have gone to hpsas without the program.  of course, a higher value for , increases the 
retention effect, as well as the overall effect of the program, .   

of the 6,209 primary care physicians who entered service between 2000 and 2015, we estimate 
that 43.1% of them join hpsas only as a result of the nhsc, i.e., 2,676 providers.  in table vi.4 
we report this number as the recruiting effect, expressed in number of providers.  if, for 
simplicity, we assume that each of these providers served full time while in hpsas, the number 
of fte-years generated by nhsc through the recruiting effect is 11,263 (=2,676*4.209), where 
4.209 is the estimate of  and was obtained as described above from the inferred retention 
rates of providers who joined hpsas only as a result of the program.  the number of 11,263 
fte-years is our estimate of the recruiting effect.  these are fte-years supplied by providers 
that would not have been offered in hpsas in the absence of the nhsc program. 

the retention effect is obtained by approximating ,  , with 2-1.8=0.2, which is the 
difference we obtain by comparing participants and unfunded eligible providers.  therefore, the 
total program effect in terms of fte-years is 2,676*4.209+6,209*0.2=12,505 for primary care 
physicians.  a similar calculation for nps and pas nhsc participants yields an estimate of 
35,308 fte-years, and a total of 27,629 fte-years for mental health providers.  the 
assumption was that ,  ,  is the same as the difference we use for the calculation of the 
retention effect of primary care physicians.

of course, these estimates should be viewed with caution.  one of the main limitations is that 
the recruiting effect estimates from table vi.1 are obtained from models in which we cannot 
control for other unobservable characteristics that may still be, at least in part, responsible for 
provider migration patterns.  another limitation is that we can only track providers for up to 10 
years after separation.  although our expected years in hpsas calculations take this into 
account, a timeframe larger than 10 years may yield larger expected years in hpsas for the 
provider types we considered.  in addition, the retention effect estimates are limited to at most 
two years, since the data on the eligible unfunded providers goes back in time only to 2013.  
also, in the case of the retention effect calculations, we cannot distinguish between physician 
and non-physician effects, because of the small number of providers that we were able to track 
after the time of application.  hence, the ,  , difference does not vary by provider type in 
our calculations from table vi.4.  not least, the ,  , difference is approximated with an 
unadjusted difference between participants and unfunded eligible participants.  ideally, we 
would need to be able to control for other local-level and provider-level characteristics in a 
regression setting to net out the impact of other characteristics on the difference, but given the 
small sample size, that is currently not possible.    

however, regardless of the exact value of the total effect on the number of provider-years in 
hpsas, the estimates from table vi.4 point to potential important program effects of the nhsc 
program in increasing the number of providers in high-need areas.  this study advances current 
knowledge on the nhsc program effect, and offers a pathway for further causal effect analyses, 
once more data on participants and eligible unfunded providers becomes available in the future.

conclusions 

national health service corps  an extended analysis 

conclusions 

in this study we continued our analysis of the national health service corps (nhsc) by 
focusing on the recent retention trends of nhsc program alumni in health professional 
shortage areas (hpsas), the retention patterns of those nhsc participants who serve in indian 
health service (ihs) sites, and on an analysis of the recruiting and retention effects of the 
program. 

we find that in the case of primary care providers, the same hpsa retention rates in the first 
years after separation from service are lower than in lewin (2014).  this suggests that the 
primary care providers who left nhsc in the more recent years leave the hpsa where they 
served at higher rates than before.  however, when comparing the any hpsa retention rates, 
it turns out that although the retention rates from this study are smaller than the ones reported in 
lewin (2014), the differences are much smaller than in the case of same hpsa retention, 
indicating that nhsc alumni still remain in hpsa at elevated rates (just as documented in lewin 
2014), but the moves from the same hpsa to any hpsa locations are more frequent in the 
recent years than in the past. we find similar retention and migration patterns in the case of 
mental health providers and in the case of indian health service nhsc participants. as we 
show in chapter iv, these differences do not seem to be driven by other provider-level or local-
level characteristics, such as age, gender, provider type, local area income, or percent of the 
population under poverty rate. 

we further develop our theoretical framework and hypothesize that a zero difference between 
the retention rates participants and non-participants is equivalent to a zero recruiting effect.  
when the program is successful in attracting providers who would not serve in hpsas without 
the incentive, then the program has a recruiting effect, and since the average hpsa preference 
for the newly attracted providers is lower than the average preference of the rest of the 
providers, it follows that the post-obligation retention rate of participants is lower than that of 
non-participants.  importantly, the retention differential becomes larger when the recruiting effect 
is larger.   

in order to be effective, nhsc must be able to induce some providers to locate in hpsas given 
that they would not have otherwise chosen those locations.  some providers who would not 
have chosen to practice in hpsas may be induced to do so by the program.  if so, they increase 
the supply of providers in the area.  this is what we call the recruiting effect of the nhsc 
program.  also, the nhsc program generates a retention effect to the extent that nhsc 
providers serve in hpsas longer than what they would if there were no program. 

we estimate the recruiting effect is based on an empirical specification in which the total 
number of providers currently serving in a hpsa is modeled as a function of the number of 
nhsc participating providers serving in in that area.  in this model we control for past levels of 
providers in the area, as well as for a number of relevant local level characteristics that typically 
influence the location choices of providers. regarding the retention effect, we make use of a 
novel dataset, that of providers who were deemed eligible for nhsc funding in the application 
process, but ended up not receiving funding, mainly because of funding limits.   

we provide a number of tentative estimates for the recruiting and retention effects for primary 
care physicians, nps and pas, and mental health providers.  in this study we face a number of 
important (and insurmountable) data limitations in the estimation of the recruiting and retention 
effects.  however, regardless of the exact value of the total effect on the number of provider-
years in hpsas, we find empirical evidence pointing to potential important program effects of 
the nhsc program in increasing the number of providers in high-need areas.
