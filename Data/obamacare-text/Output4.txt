medicaid expansion impacts on insurance coverage and access to care 

 

updated january 18, 2017  

 
 
under current law, medicaid provides enhanced federal matching funds to states to cover the cost of 
expanding coverage to nonelderly adults (ages 19 to 64) with income less than 138 percent of the federal 
poverty level (fpl). a 100 percent federal match rate applies only to newly eligible individuals in the 
expansion population for 2014-2016 and is being phased down incrementally to 90 percent by 2020. the 
target population for this expansion includes parents and childless adults who were previously ineligible 
for medicaid coverage.  to date, a total of 31 states and the district of columbia have expanded 
medicaid.  
 
this issue brief, which provides a literature review of the effects of medicaid expansion, was first 
released in june 2016 and has been updated to include additional information and data from 2016. 
specifically, the brief focuses on the effects of expansion on health coverage and access, affordability, 
financial security, and quality of care. the first section of this issue brief examines the evidence to date 
on the impact of medicaid expansion on health coverage. the second section explores the beneficiary 
impacts of medicaid expansion by examining access to care and utilization.  the third section examines 
research to date on affordability, financial security, and quality including enrollee financial well-being, 
satisfaction and experience.  this literature review adds to prior aspe research on the economic impacts 
of medicaid expansion including the impact on the cost of uncompensated care.1

key highlights 

  medicaid expansion has had an effect on insurance coverage, including a reduction of 

uninsured adults in the united states.  

o  expansion states realized a 9.2 percentage point reduction in the number of 
uninsured adults (a 49.5 percent decline in the uninsured rate) since 2014.  

o  non-expansion states realized a 7.9 percentage point reduction in the 

uninsured rate among uninsured adults (a 33.8 percent decline in the uninsured 
rate) since 2014. 

o  recent research demonstrates that the raw difference in trends between 
expansion and non-expansion states actually understates the benefits of 
expansion because non-expansion states started with higher uninsured rates.  

 

  medicaid expansion has increased access to primary care, expanded use of 

prescription medications, and increased rates of diagnosis of chronic conditions for 
new enrollees. 
 

  low-income individuals living in expansion states generally had a greater increase in 
the use of preventive services recommended by the united states preventive services 
task force (uspstf) than low-income individuals living in non-expansion states. 
 

  medicaid expansion has improved the financial security and affordability of care for 

expansion enrollees.  

o  medicaid expansion reduced the likelihood of being at risk for personal 

bankruptcy and reduced third-party collections by $600 to $1000 per 
individual.  

according to the health reform monitoring survey: 

o  the percentage of low-income adults reporting problems paying medical bills 
declined by 10.5 percentage points (34.7 percent pre-expansion to 24.2 percent 
post-expansion). 

o  unmet health care among low-income adults declined 10.5 percentage points 

(55.3 percent pre-expansion to 44.8 percent post-expansion). 
 

  medicaid expansion has provided quality care to new enrollees.  according to the 

commonwealth funds affordable care act tracking survey: 

o  nearly two-thirds (61 percent) of adults with medicaid expansion coverage 
consider themselves to be better off now than they were before enrolling in 
medicaid. 

o  88 percent of adults are very or somewhat satisfied with their medicaid health 

plans. 

o  92 percent are very or somewhat satisfied with their plan doctors.

section i. impact of medicaid expansion on health insurance coverage 
 
medicaid enrollment  
 
as of october 2016, the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) reported that over 74 million 
individuals were enrolled in medicaid/chip. since the beginning of the first open enrollment period 
for marketplaces in october 2013, medicaid/chip enrollment has grown by 17 million individuals, or 
30 percent.2 enrollment growth in medicaid expansion states has been significantly larger than in non-
expansion states. on average, medicaid expansion states have experienced a 37.1 percent growth in 
enrollment, compared to a 16.5 percent growth in non-expansion states.3 this difference in medicaid 
enrollment growth is consistent with the difference in coverage gains between expansion and non-
expansion states described below. 
 
the reduction in uninsured 
 

associated with the expansion of medicaid has been a reduction of the uninsured. an analysis of the 
gallup-healthways well-being index data through early 2016 (february 22, 2016), shows that the 
reduction in the uninsured rate for non-elderly adults was greater among medicaid expansion states than 
among non-expansion states (see figure 1).i these estimates imply that medicaid expansion contributed 
significantly to reducing the number of uninsured people in the nation.   

 

  among medicaid expansion states, the uninsured rate for non-elderly adults declined 9.2 

percentage points (a 49.5 percent decline), from a baseline uninsured of 18.5 percent to 9.3 
percent.  

  among non-expansion states, the uninsured rate for non-elderly adults declined 7.9 percentage 

points (a 33.8 percent decline), from a baseline uninsured of 23.3 percent to 15.4 percent. 

 
in fact, the raw difference in the reduction in the uninsured rate between expansion and non-expansion 
states likely substantially understates the effect of medicaid expansion.  figure 1 shows that the 
uninsured rate was substantially lower in expansion states than in non-expansion states before coverage 
expansions took effect at the beginning of 2014. recent research has found that, due to the uninsured 
populations in expansion states, the other coverage expansions have generated smaller reductions in the 
uninsured rate in those states, partially masking the beneficial effect of medicaid expansion 
(courtemanche et al., 2016; furman, 2015).4,5  
 
the impact of medicaid expansion on reducing uninsurance extends beyond the expansion population.  
alker and chester (2016) found the uninsurance rate for children age 18 and under fell by 2.3 
percentage points from 7.1 percent in 2013 to 4.8 percent in 2015 and the number of uninsured children 
fell from 5.2 million to 3.5 million.6 alker and chester (2015) also found that expansion states saw 

                                                 
i the gallup estimates presented here are from january 2012 through february 2016 and encompass the total population, not 
just individuals with income 138 percent fpl. accordingly, the estimates in this issue brief differ from the estimates 
presented in the sommers, et al., changes in self-reported insurance coverage, access to care, and health under the 
affordable care act, jama 2015.

section ii. impact of medicaid expansion on access 
 
usual source of care 
 
usual source of care (e.g., a particular medical professional, office, clinic, or community health center) 
is a key metric for measuring access to care because it reflects a stable connection with the health care 
delivery system. beneficiaries with a usual source of care often receive more preventive services and 
better manage chronic conditions; and in turn receive more effective and efficient health care. overall, 
the literature indicates that medicaid expansion is associated with an increase in individuals reporting a 
usual source of care. an aspe analysis of the national health interview survey (nhis) found that 
between 2013 and 2015, medicaid expansion states saw a 7.2 percentage point increase in the number of 
low-income adults (non-elderly, 138 percent fpl)  reporting a usual source of care, while states that 
did not expand medicaid saw a 1.3 percentage point increase among this group.ii furthermore, focus 
                                                 
ii aspe analysis of national health interview survey (nhis) data from 2010-2015. states are defined as medicaid expansion 
states if they expanded medicaid at any point between march 23, 2010 and december 31, 2015. the analyses here use final 
nhis public use files merged with restricted identifiers, which include various edits not in the preliminary microdata used for 
nhis early release reports produced by the national center for health statistics (nchs). estimates in this brief may vary 
slightly from those in nchss published reports for this reason.

group findings show that low-income adults reported that obtaining coverage enabled them to access 
needed care such as primary and preventive care, as well as to address their specific health problems. 
highlighted below are key findings to date in the literature related to sources of care and appointment 
availability (table 1).

appointment 
availability 

  medicaid expansion was associated with a 4.5 percentage point increase in visits to a health 

professional compared to a 1.0 percentage point increase in non-expansion states. 

  medicaid expansion was associated with a significant reduction in low-income adults who lack a 

personal physician (-1.8 percentage points) compared to non-expansion states. 

  medicaid expansion increased the probability of childless adults having a personal doctor by 4.1 

 

percentage points. 
individuals with chronic conditions who obtained regular care increased by 11.6 percentage 
points after the first year of arkansas private option expansion and kentuckys traditional 
medicaid expansion compared to texas a non-expansion state. 

  community health center visit rates increased by 46 percent in expansion states compared to 12 

percent in non-expansion states. 

  a study that focused on michigan found that primary care appointment availability increased by 6 

percentage points (from 49 percent pre-medicaid expansion to 55 percent) for all new medicaid 
patients after expansion. 

  a study of 10 states found that availability of primary care appointments for medicaid patients 

increased by 7.7 percentage points (from 58.7 percent in late 2012 to early 2013 to 66.4 percent in 
mid-2014). 

 
personal physician. the aspe analysis of the nhis data further found that in expansion states, low-
income non-elderly adults experienced a 4.5 percentage point increase in visits to a health professional 
from 2013 to 2015, while in nonexpansion states this population had a 1.0 percentage point increase on 
this measure. similarly, wherry and miller (2016) found that low-income nonelderly adult citizens in 
medicaid expansion states were 6.6 percentage points more likely to have seen or talked to a general 
physician in the previous 12 months than counterparts in non-expansion states. iii 
according  to sommers, gunja, finegold, and musco (2015), medicaid expansion has significantly 
increased the proportion of low-income adults who report having a personal physician.8 using the 
gallup healthways well-being index survey data, sommers et al. (2015) finds that medicaid expansion 
was associated with a significant reduction in low-income adults who lack a personal physician (-1.8 
percentage points) compared to non-expansion states. simon, soni and cawley (2016) examined the 
impact of medicaid expansion on preventive care and found that childless adults, the targeted population 
for expansion, were 4.1 percentage points more likely to have a personal doctor after expansion as 
compared to the pre-expansion timeframe.9   
 

                                                 
iii the wherry and miller analysis was based on data from the second half of 2014, the look back period includes months 
prior to the january 1, 2014 expansion and does not capture gains in subsequent months, so it may understate the increase in 
physician visits in states that expanded medicaid.

when examining usual source of care on a state basis, sommers, blendon and orav (2016) found the 
share of low-income adults with chronic conditions who obtained regular care increased by 11.6 
percentage points after the first year of expansion in arkansas and kentucky compared to the non-
expansion state texas.10   
 
community health centers. hoopes et al. (2016) examined changes in community health center visits 
between medicaid expansion states and non-expansion states.11 the authors found that one-year after 
medicaid expansion, community health center visit rates increased by 46 percent in expansion states 
compared to 12 percent in non-expansion states.  
 
appointment availability. another study measured primary care wait times for appointments and 
appointment availability pre- and post- medicaid expansion for new medicaid patients in michigan and 
concluded that access to services improved post-expansion.12 specifically, tipirneni et al. (2015) found 
that wait times for primary care appointments remained stable (1-2 weeks) and appointment availability 
increased by 6 percentage points (from 49 percent pre-medicaid expansion to 55 percent for new 
medicaid patients after expansion). similarly, polsky et al. (2015) measured the availability of and 
waiting times for appointments in 10 states in late 2012 to early 2013 and again in mid-2014.13 the 
authors in this study found that the availability of primary care appointments for medicaid beneficiaries 
increased by 7.7 percentage points (from 58.7 percent to 66.4 percent). this increase in appointment 
availability was attributed to a temporary increase in medicaid reimbursement to primary care providers. 
the states with the largest increases in appointment availability also were most likely to have the largest 
increases in reimbursements.   
 
health care services 
 
a review of the literature examining the impacts of medicaid expansion on specific services has 
generally found that the newly enrolled medicaid population is better able to access preventive services, 
needed prescription medications, be screened and diagnosed for chronic conditions, and access dental 
care. furthermore, the payer mix for hospital admissions appears to have changed in expansion states 
with a decline in uninsured admissions (table 2).

41 percent increase in preventive visits in medicaid expansion states compared to no change 
in non-expansion states in community health centers. 
26 percent of uninsured individuals who obtained medicaid coverage in 2014 had an annual 
check-up as compared to 14 percent of uninsured individuals. 
22 percent of uninsured individuals who obtained medicaid coverage in 2014 had a blood 
pressure screening compared to 13 percent of uninsured individuals. 

  low-income individuals who lived in expansion states generally had a greater increase in the 

use of preventive services recommended by the united states preventive services task 
force (uspstf) than low-income individuals living in non-expansion states between 2013 
and 2015.  
o  colorectal cancer screenings: among adults ages 50-64, colorectal cancer screening 

increased by 4.3 percentage points in expansion states, compared to no increase in non-
expansion states. 

o  high cholesterol screenings: among men ages 35-64, high cholesterol screenings 

increased by 3.4 percentage points in expansion states and decreased by 3.7 percentage

increased by 3.7 percentage points, compared to 1.2 percentage points in non-expansion 
states.

  the use of recommended preventive services is higher in expansion states than non-

expansion states for nearly all preventive services analyzed 

prescription drugs 

 

in 2014, the number of medicaid prescriptions increased 25.4 percent in states that expanded 
coverage, compared to only 2.8 percent in states that didnt expand coverage. 

  uninsured individuals who gained medicaid coverage had increases in prescription drug fill 

rates (79 percent increase) and reductions in out-of-pocket spending per prescription (58 
percent reduction).

  the probability of having a dental visit increased by 4.1 percentage points for childless 

adults gaining medicaid coverage. 

  cost related barriers to dental care fell from 30 percent in 2013 prior to medicaid expansion 

to 25 percent in 2014 post medicaid expansion. 

  among medicaid expansion states, hospital admissions for uninsured patients decreased by

preventive services. hoopes et al. (2016) found that in addition to increases in community health center 
visits after medicaid expansion, the centers provided a greater number of preventive services visits. 
community health centers experienced a 41 percent increase in preventive visits in medicaid expansion 
states compared to no change in non-expansion states. in a study using longitudinal survey data, kirby 
and vistnes (2016) found that gaining medicaid coverage in 2014 resulted in a higher likelihood of 
having a usual source of care and receiving preventive services. when compared to uninsured 
individuals, individuals who gained medicaid coverage in 2014 were more likely to have obtained an 
annual check-up (26 percent in medicaid compared to 14 percent uninsured) and more likely to have 
obtained a blood pressure screening (22 percent in medicaid compared to 13 percent uninsured).14 
 
aspe analysis of national health interview survey (nhis) data from 2013 to 2015 found that overall the 
use of preventive services recommended by the united states preventive services task force (uspstf) was 
higher in expansion states than non-expansion states for nearly all preventive services analyzed (see 
appendix a for additional details).  in addition, the aspe analysis found that low-income individuals who 
lived in expansion states generally had a greater increase in the use of preventive services recommended 
by the uspstf than low-income individuals living in non-expansion states.  some of the largest 
differences in preventive service use between expansion and non-expansion states include: 
 

o  colorectal cancer screenings: among adults ages 50-64, colorectal cancer screening 

increased by 4.3 percentage points in expansion states, compared to no increase in non-
expansion states. 

o  cholesterol screening: among men ages 35-64, screening for high cholesterol increased by 

3.4 percentage points in expansion states and decreased by 3.7 percentage points in non-
expansion states. among women ages 45-64, screening for high cholesterol increased by 3.7 
percentage points, compared to 1.2 percentage points in non-expansion states. 

o  blood pressure screening: among adults ages 18-64, screening for high blood pressure 
increased by 4.0 percentage points in expansions states, compared to decreasing by 1.8 
percentage points in non-expansion states. 

o  hiv screening: among adults ages 18-64, hiv screenings increased by 3.4 percentage points 

in expansions states, compared to decreasing by 0.1 percentage points in non-expansion 
states. 

dental care: improved access to coverage also extends to dental care visits. in 80 percent of expansion 
states, medicaid provides at least some coverage for outpatient dental services.15 simon, soni, and 
cawley (2016) examined rates of dental care visits and found that the probability of a dental visit 
increased among childless adults by 4.1 percentage points after expansion. along with improved access, 
medicaid expansion may be reducing cost-related barriers to needed dental care. nasseh, wall, and 
vujicic (2015) found that for adults with income below 100 percent fpl, cost related barriers to dental

aspe issue brief 
 
 
care fell from 30 percent in 2013 prior to medicaid expansion to 25 percent in 2014 post medicaid 
expansion.16  
 
early diagnosis and treatment of chronic medical conditions: improved access to coverage can also 
result in earlier diagnosis and treatment of chronic medical conditions. recent analysis of laboratory 
data from kaufman, chen, fonseca, and mcphaul (2015) found that an increased number of medicaid 
patients with diabetes are being diagnosed in medicaid expansion states (23 percent increase in 
medicaid expansion states versus a .4 percent increase in non-expansion states).17 wherry and miller 
(2016), using survey data, found increases in diagnosis of diabetes and high cholesterol for low-income 
adult citizens in medicaid expansion states compared with those in non-expansion states. an evaluation 
of the medicaid expansion conducted by the medicaid department in ohio concluded that the medicaid 
expansion improved access to care and treatment of chronic health conditions. the evaluators found that 
after obtaining coverage, over one-quarter (27 percent) of new medicaid expansion enrollees in ohio 
were diagnosed with at least one chronic health condition and according to the medical records studied 
as part of the evaluation, the individuals subsequently had lower levels of high blood pressure or high 
cholesterol since enrolling in medicaid. 
 
prescription medications: access to prescription medications has also expanded for low-income adults 
in medicaid expansion states compared to non-expansion states. in 2014, the number of medicaid 
prescriptions increased 25.4 percent in states that expanded coverage, compared to only 2.8 percent in 
states that did not expand coverage.18 mulcahy, eibner and finegold (2016) used prescription drug 
transaction data to examine changes in coverage, prescription fills, and out-of-pocket spending on 
prescription drugs as a result of coverage expansions. the researchers found that uninsured individuals 
who gained medicaid coverage had increases in prescription drug fill rates (79 percent increase) and 
reductions in out-of-pocket spending per prescription (58 percent reduction).19 the large increases in 
prescription drug fill rates suggests that expanded access to coverage has helped many medicaid 
beneficiaries obtain affordable treatment for their health conditions with the long-term goal of 
improving their health.20 this is consistent with the aspe analysis of the nhis, which found that there 
was a 7 percentage point decrease (a 37 percent reduction) in the number of non-elderly adults with 
incomes 138 percent fpl forgoing prescription drugs because of cost between 2010 and 2015. 
similarly, sommers, blendon and orav found a 10 percentage point decline in the number of low-
income adults claiming they skipped prescribed medication because of cost in their survey of low-
income adults after the first year of expansion in kentucky and arkansas compared to non-expansion 
state texas. 
 
hospitalizations: improving access to coverage due to medicaid expansion may also be measured by a 
changing payer mix for providers. studies have found that medicaid expansion is ensuring more 
consistent reimbursement to hospitals for care provided and is also producing benefits for patients who 
require hospitalization. estimates from the nikpay, buchmueller, and levy (2016) study show that since 
expansion, among medicaid expansion states, hospital admissions for uninsured patients decreased by 6 
percentage points (50 percent decrease in uninsured hospital discharges) while the percentage of 
admissions paid for by medicaid increased by 7 percentage points (20 percent increase in medicaid 
discharges) in the first half of 2014.21  a study conducted by hellinger (2015) found a greater decline in 
the uninsured share of hospitalizations for people with hiv in four medicaid expansion states (60 
percent decline) compared to non-expansion states (8 percent increase). 22 further, the study concluded 

 
aspe office of health policy 

january 18, 2017 

 

page 10 

aspe issue brief 
 
 
that uninsured hiv patients who were in the hospital were 40 percent more likely to die during their stay 
as compared to patients with insurance.  
 
health behaviors: the research conducted by simon, soni and cawley (2016) found no evidence of 
moral hazard. new insurance coverage for additional individuals may lead to moral hazard, where 
individuals would engage in risky health behaviors now that they are no longer facing the full 
financial cost of obtaining health care services. simon et al found there was no impact of medicaid 
expansion affecting risky behaviors such as increased heavy drinking, binge drinking, obesity, increased 
bmi or reduced levels of exercise among childless adults with medicaid coverage.23 
 
 
section iii. impact of medicaid expansion on affordability, financial 
security, and quality 
 
in addition to increased coverage and access to care, studies and survey results show medicaid 
beneficiaries report increased financial security and satisfaction with the affordability and quality of 
medicaid, their health coverage, and the doctors included in their plans (table 3).

affordability  

 

78 percent of medicaid expansion enrollees who have used their plan indicated that they 
would not have been able to access and/or afford their care prior to medicaid expansion 
and enrollment. 

  the probability of reporting cost as a barrier to care decreased by 3.9 percentage points for 

childless adults gaining medicaid coverage. 

  medicaid expansion is associated with a 20 percent reduction among adults in foregoing 

mental health care or counseling due to cost from 2013 to 2015. 

  the percentage of low-income adults reporting problems paying medical bills also declined 

by 10.5 percentage points (34.7 percent pre-expansion to 24.2 percent post-expansion).  

  enrollees in expansion states reported a 7 percentage point decline in problems paying their 

medical bills compared to a 2 percentage point decline in non-expansion states. 

  families reporting an inability to pay medical bills due to cost declined 5 percentage points 

in expansion states compared to 1 percentage point in non-expansion states. 

  both traditional medicaid expansion and private option expansion led to a decline in the 

percentage of low-income adults reporting trouble paying medical bills (12.9 percent 
decrease and 4.8 percent decrease respectively).  

  post-medicaid expansion in california, the likelihood of any family out-of-pocket medical 

spending among low-income adults declined by 10 percentage points. 

  unmet health care needs decreased among low-income adults, declining 10.5 percentage 

points (55.3 percent pre-expansion to 44.8 percent post-expansion). 

  medicaid expansion reduced third-party collections of medical debt by $600 to $1,000 per 

individual.

  medicaid expansion helped to reduce the likelihood of having trouble or being unable to 

pay medical debt with 53 percent of uninsured adults reporting issues compared to 18

affordability. according to results from the commonwealth fund affordable care act tracking 
survey of nonelderly adults (ages 19 to 64), among medicaid enrollees who have had medicaid for less 
than two years and have used their coverage, 78 percent indicated that they would not have been able to 
access and/or afford their care prior to medicaid expansion and enrollment. 24 further, kosali, soni and 
cawley (2016) found that childless adults who obtained medicaid coverage were less likely to report 
cost as a barrier to obtaining care (probability reduced by 3.9 percentage points). in addition, an aspe 
analysis of national health interview survey (nhis) data found a 20 percent reduction in the number of 
non-elderly adults with incomes 138 percent fpl that have forgone mental health care or counseling 
due to cost between 2013 and 2015 and a 33 percent reduction among this population from 2010 to 
2015.25   
 
as shown in table 4, an aspe analysis of nhis data comparing medicaid expansion to non-expansion 
states during the pre and post expansion period (2013 and 2015) found that medicaid expansion resulted 
in lower health care costs for low-income families and receipt of more affordable care. to measure 
lowered health care costs, aspe analyzed nhis data on the amount that low-income families (those 
with family incomes below 138% fpl) spent on medical/dental care during the prior 12 month period. 
the analysis shows that the percent of families that spent $0 on health care increased substantially in 
expansion states (5.2 percentage points), yet declined in non-expansion states (-1.5 percentage points) 
over the study period.

considered to be non-expansion states for the purposes of this analysis (including states that implemented expansion in 2016).    
family was the unit of analyses based on the definition used in the nhis data set. 
 
similarly, estimates from a study using data from the health reform monitoring survey, found that 
affordability of care improved post-expansion.26 the percentage of low-income adults reporting 
problems paying medical bills declined by 10.5 percentage points (34.7 percent pre-expansion to 24.2 
percent post-expansion). aspe analysis of nhis data show the reduction in problems paying medical 
bills also hold true by medicaid expansion status. enrollees in expansion states reported a 3.3 percentage 
point decline in problems paying their medical bills compared to a 1.5 percentage point decline in non-
expansion states (appendix b). further, families reporting an inability to pay medical bills due to cost 
declined 2.3 percentage points in expansion states compared to 1.2 percentage points in non-expansion 
states (appendix b). each of these measures helps to show that increasing medicaid coverage to low-
income families has assisted in improving their household financial well-being. for additional measures 
on improved affordability from the aspe analysis of nhis data from 2013 and 2015, see appendix b. 
 
studies that examined the impact of medicaid expansion on affordability at the state level also found 
results similar to those found using survey data. for example, golberstein, gonzales, and sommers 
(2015) examined the affordability of care after the early medicaid expansion in california and found 
that expansion significantly reduced the likelihood of any family out-of-pocket medical spending among 
low-income adults by 10 percentage points.27 furthermore, sommers, blendon and orav found 
compared to a non-expansion state (texas) both traditional medicaid expansion (kentucky) and private 
option (using medicaid funds to purchase private coverage) expansion (arkansas) lead to a decline in 
the number of individuals reporting trouble paying medical bills (12.9 percent decrease and 4.8 percent 
decrease, respectively). 
 
lastly, the estimates from the health reform monitoring survey also showed that self-reported unmet 
health care needs decreased among low-income adults, declining 10.5 percentage points (55.3 percent 
pre-expansion to 44.8 percent post-expansion). the authors concluded that the decline was likely an 
effect of the strong cost-sharing protections associated with medicaid plans. 
 
financial security. the medicaid expansion has also had important financial impacts on enrollees. hu, 
kaestner, mazumder, miller, and wong (2016) analyzed a large random sample of credit reports to 
compare people living in the zip codes most likely to be affected by medicaid expansion with a 
synthetic control group from non-expansion states.28 this method controls for potential selection effects 
due to differences in covariates such as income, race, and ethnicity between expansion and non-
expansion states. the authors estimated that medicaid expansion reduced the likelihood of being at risk 
for personal bankruptcy and reduced third-party collections by $600 to $1,000 per individual. in a 
separate survey on the burden of medical debt conducted by the kaiser family foundation/new york 
times, the survey team found that medicaid expansion helped to reduce the likelihood of medical debt. 
they found that 53 percent of uninsured adults reported having trouble or being unable to pay medical 
debt compared to 18 percent of adults in the expansion population.29 with fewer unpaid bills to reduce 
their credit ratings, and a lowered possibility of entering bankruptcy, these individuals may experience 
better financial well-being in future years.

a state level analysis conducted in new york, an expansion state, found similar results. based on 
observing data from federal reserve bank of new yorks consumer credit panel (ccp) over the first 
quarter of 2009 through the fourth quarter of 2015, and aggregating it to the county level,iv the ny fed 
saw that in counties with high uninsurance rates prior to 2014, collections declined by more than $100 
per capita on average in the fourth quarter of 2015 (ny fed). this is a significant amount, given that the 
average balances in collection over the sample period was $280 per person. similar to the national level 
analysis, the ny fed also found that reductions in the relative amount of debt sent to third party 
collections following medicaid expansion were most significant in expansion state counties with the 
highest levels of uninsured individuals pre-2010. further, counties that had a high uninsurance burden 
before 2010 but subsequently expanded medicaid had a decrease in average debt sent to collections 
agencies in relation to counties in non-medicaid expansion states. 
 
 
quality 
 
enrollee satisfaction. the commonwealth fund survey found satisfaction with the new coverage 
overall was also high. of the medicaid adults enrolled in medicaid for less than three years, almost nine 
in ten (88 percent) were very or somewhat satisfied with their medicaid health plans. the survey also 
indicated that among adults enrolled in medicaid plans for less than two years who used their plan, 92 
percent were very or somewhat satisfied with their plan doctors.  
 
enrollee experience. in addition to the decrease in reported unmet need care found by the health 
reform monitoring survey, nearly two-thirds (61 percent) of adults with coverage due to their states 
medicaid expansion in the commonwealth fund survey consider themselves to be better off now than 
they were prior to medicaid expansion. 
  
 
section iv: conclusion 
 
medicaid expansion has resulted in improved rates of coverage for low-income adults and improved 
access to care and affordability for enrollees. states that have expanded medicaid have experienced 
increased enrollment in their state programs and greater reductions in their uninsured population. 
 
evidence shows that once covered, the newly enrolled population can obtain primary care services, be 
screened and diagnosed for chronic conditions, and access needed prescription medications and dental 
care. enrollees report satisfaction with their health coverage, the doctors included in their plan and the 
affordability of medicaid. 
 
going forward, additional research will be critical to documenting the longer-term impacts of the 
medicaid expansion in terms of long-term rates of coverage, health care access, and the impact of 
expansion on health outcomes and overall population health. sommers, baicker and epstein found pre- 
2014 medicaid expansions to cover low-income adults were significantly associated with reduced 

                                                 
iv the dataset used in the observation done at the new york federal reserve board was the same dataset used in the separate 
study authored by hu et. al. and published by the national bureau of economic research.

mortality as well as improved coverage, access to care, and self-reported health. 30 the long term effect 
of medicaid expansion on health outcomes therefore merits close examination in future research.

appendix c: data methodology 
 
the estimates of changes in the uninsured rate for nonelderly adults in expansion and non-expansion 
states presented in this brief (figure 1) are based on aspe analysis of data from the gallup-healthways 
well-being index, which surveys about 500 adults per day. the gallup-healthways well-being index 
estimates presented here are based on data from january 1, 2012 through february 22, 2016.v 
 
aspes estimates of changes in access to care for nonelderly adults are based on analysis of national 
health interview survey (nhis) data from 2010-2015. states are defined as medicaid expansion states 
if they expanded medicaid at any point between march 23, 2010 and december 31, 2015. the analyses 
here use final nhis public use files merged with restricted identifiers, which include various edits not in 
the preliminary microdata used for nhis early release reports produced by the national center for 
health statistics (nchs). estimates in this brief may vary slightly from those in nchss published 
reports for this reason. 
 
aspes analysis of cost of care and ability to pay medical bills used the nhis definition of a family 
as the unit of analysis. the analyses were conducted using 2013 as the pre-expansion period and 2015 as 
the post-expansion period. states that implemented medicaid expansion between january 1, 2014, the 
year in which the majority of states enacted the policy, and january 1, 2015 are defined as expansion
