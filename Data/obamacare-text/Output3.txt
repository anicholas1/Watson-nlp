credits when making health plan choices in the 2016 aca marketplaces? 

 

january 18, 2017 

 
the affordable care act established the health insurance marketplaces (marketplaces) to provide 
consumers with choices of affordable health plans offered in a competitive insurance market. 
healthcare.gov and state-run marketplaces offer detailed information about each health insurance plan 
sold in an area, including the premiums, deductibles, other out-of-pocket costs, provider network, and 
more. consumers can obtain information regarding their expected premium after tax credits by inputting 
their age, income, family size, geographic location, and smoking status when shopping.   
 
previous modeling by aspe assumed that consumers make their plan choices based on their expected 
premiums net of tax credits.i however, as there is much public reporting each year  especially in the 
media  regarding premium growth that does not take into account the countervailing effect of premium 
tax credits, it is conceivable that increases in gross premiums could have an effect on consumers plan 
choices.  
 
to explore whether consumers responded to changes in net or gross premiums when making health plan 
choices in the 2016 aca marketplaces, we conducted two sets of analyses, one based on comparing 
counties and one based on comparing individuals.   

 

in the county-level analysis, we conduct a statistical analysis comparing plan switching rates across 
counties by changes in average enrollment-weighted gross premiums between 2015 and 2016 and by 
changes in benchmark premiums between 2015 and 2016. the logic behind the county-level analysis is 
that, in counties in which average gross premiums increased yet benchmark premiums kept pace, most 
consumers likely saw little change in their premiums net of tax credits.  thus, if consumers are 
responding only to net premiums when making plan choices, it should not matter, in these counties, 
whether gross premiums increased by a large or small degree.  however, if consumers are responding to 
increases in gross premiums when making plan decisions, we likely would see more consumers 
switching plans in counties when gross premiums increase regardless of whether benchmark premiums 
kept pace.

in our individual-level analysis, we conduct a statistical analysis examining whether consumers were 
more likely to switch plans in 2016 when their gross premium increased, or when their net premium 
increased.   
 

  comparing counties, we find:  

key findings 

o  a substantially greater fraction of marketplace enrollees switched plans in 
2016 when average premiums increased but benchmark premiums did not 
keep pace than if premiums did not change. 

  for example, we estimate that a $50 increase in average premiums 

with no change in benchmark premiums would lead to a 9.8 
percentage point increase in the switching rate (a 37% increase). 

o  when average premiums increased but benchmark premiums increased by the 

same amount, the fraction of marketplace enrollees that switched plans in 
2016 increased by a small amount, consistent with the fact that only a small 
percentage of enrollees are not eligible for premium tax credits.   

  for example, we estimate that a $50 increase in both average 

premiums and benchmark premiums led to a 3 percentage point 
increase (11%) in the switching rate. 

o  these results suggest that consumers primarily respond to net premiums, 

rather than to gross premiums, when making plan selections in 2016.  

  examining consumer decisions at the individual-level, we find: 

o  consumers were much more likely to switch plans when the net premium of 
their 2015 plan increased (e.g., when that plans premium increases by more 
than the benchmark premium), but were not more likely to switch plans when 
the gross premium of their 2015 increased but the net premium did not.  

  for example, we estimate that, if both net premiums and gross 

premiums increased by $50, the fraction of enrollees switching plans 
in 2016 increased 7.4 percentage points (34%).  however, if gross 
premiums increased by $50 but net premiums did not change, there 
was no increase in the fraction of enrollees switching plans. 

o  these results also suggest that consumers only responded to net premiums, 

and did not respond to gross premiums, when making plan selections in 2016.  

 

 

i.  consumer responsiveness to changes in average and benchmark 

premiums at the county level 

 
a. motivation 
 
counties experienced large variation in their rates of premium growth  both growth in average 
premiums and benchmark premiums  between 2015 and 2016.  because of the way in which tax credits 
are calculated, consumers who are eligible for premium tax credits (roughly 85% of marketplace 
enrollees in 2015), experience no increase in premiums net of tax credits if benchmark premiums 
increase by the same amount as their plans premium. (for the purposes of this analysis, we hold 
consumers age, family composition, and income constant.)  thus, we would expect to see little 
difference in consumer behavior across counties in which average premiums and benchmark premiums 

 

2 

increased by the same amount, if consumers responded to premiums net of tax credits when making plan 
decisions. however, if consumers respond to average premiums without taking into account tax credits, 
we would see greater responsiveness (in terms of plan switching) among consumers in counties in which 
average premiums increased substantially regardless of whether benchmark premiums kept pace. 
 
b. approach 
 
to conduct this analysis, we calculate the enrollment-weighted average age 21 marketplace premium in 
each county in 2015 and 2016 using enrollment and premium data from cms on states using the 
healthcare.gov platform in both 2015 and 2016.  we also calculate the benchmark premium in each 
county in each year.  finally, we calculate the county-level switching rate as the fraction of individuals 
in a county that purchased marketplace coverage in both 2015 and 2016 who selected a different plan in 
2016 than in 2015.ii  
 
table 1 reports the average and standard deviation of these premiums in each year as well as of the 
switching rate in 2016.

findings 

we conduct a statistical analysis in which we related the county-level switching rate to the 2015 to 2016 
changes in the county-level average premium and the county-specific benchmark premium using linear 
regression.  we estimate two specifications, one in which the change in premiums are measured in 
dollars, and one in which the change in premiums are measured in percentage terms.  the results of this 
statistical analysis are reported in appendix table 1.  
 
 
c. 
 
the county-level switching rate was highly sensitive to changes in average premiums and was 
sensitive only to a small degree to changes in average premiums net of changes in benchmark 
premiums in 2016, based on the results of our statistical model. 
 
this result is illustrated in table 2 and in figure 1.  in both, we report the estimated increase in the 
county-level switching rate in response to a $50 increase in both the average and benchmark premium 
and the estimated increase in the switching rate in response to a $50 increase in the average premium 
with no change in the benchmark premium.iii  in the case in which average premiums increase and 
benchmark premiums keep pace, most consumers would not see much of a change in their premiums net 
of tax credits.  however, in the case in which average premiums increase but benchmark premiums do 
not change, all consumers would see their premiums increase as tax credits would not change from their 
previous-year levels.   
 
in 2016, the average county-level switching rate was 21.5%.  the results show that the switching rate 
was substantially higher  9.8 percentage points higher  in counties in which average premiums 
increased by $50 but benchmark premiums did not change.  by contrast, the switching rate was only 
slightly higher  3.0 percentage points higher  in counties in which both average and benchmark 
premiums increased by $50.  this finding is consistent with the fact that only a small percentage of 
marketplace consumers were not eligible for tax credits in 2015 and 2016.

iii these estimates are based on the specification, reported in appendix table 1, in which we measure changes in premiums in 
levels.  we prefer this specification because premiums net of tax credits are designed to remain constant only if benchmark 
premiums increase by the same amount, in dollar terms, as the increase in premiums.

the findings presented in table 2 and in figure 1 are consistent with consumers being sensitive to the 
net premium rather than to the gross premium when making health plan choices in 2016.   
 

ii.  consumer responsiveness to changes in net and gross premiums at 

the individual level 

 
a.   motivation 
 
consumers also experienced large variation in how much the gross premium of their 2015 plan 
increased in 2016 and in how much the premium, net of tax credits, of their 2015 selected plan increased 
in 2016.  in this section, we explore whether consumers are sensitive to changes in their net premium or 
to changes in their gross premium when making marketplace plan choice decisions.  
 
consumers who were enrolled in marketplace plans in 2015 could have seen these premiums change to 
varying degrees in 2016.  moreover, they also could have seen changes in their net premiums 
depending, in addition, upon how their benchmark premium changed between 2015 and 2016.  2016 
premium tax credits also could change if the consumers family income or family size changed.  
 
because of the same underlying variation across areas in premiums and benchmark premiums discussed 
in the previous section, there was a great deal of variation across consumers in terms of how gross and 
net premiums changed between 2015 and 2016.  we use this variation to determine whether consumers 
respond to changes in their gross premium or to changes in their net premium when making 2016 plan 
choices. 
 
b. approach 
 
to conduct the individual-level analysis, we restrict the population to 2016 marketplace enrollees who 
were also enrolled in 2015.  for each of these consumers, we determine both the gross premium and the 
premium net of any advanced premium tax credits of the plan selected in 2015.  we also determine the 
2016 gross premium of the plan the consumer selected in 2015.  the difference in gross premiums, for a 
consumer, between 2015 and 2016 is calculated as the difference between the 2015 and 2016 premium 

 

5 

of the plan selected in 2015.  we calculate the 2016 net premium of the plan the consumer selected in 
2015 as the 2016 gross premium of that plan less the amount of aptc the consumer was eligible for in 
2016.  the difference in net premium between 2015 and 2016 is calculated as the difference between the 
2015 and 2016 net premiums of the plan selected in 2015.  finally, we determine that a consumer 
switched plans between 2015 and 2016 if the plan selected in 2016 is different from the plan selected in 
2015.iv     
 
table 3 reports the average and standard deviation of premiums in each year and of the individual level

one could determine whether consumers respond to changes in gross or net premiums by estimating 
linear regressions of the probability of switching plans in 2016 where the change in the net premium of 
the 2015 selected plan and the change in the gross premium of the 2015 selected plan are the 
independent variables. however, this approach is complicated by the fact that the change in the net 
premium between 2015 and 2016 likely is endogenous.  this endogeneity could arises because changes 
in income or changes in family size should have a direct effect on whether a consumer changes plans 
above and beyond any indirect effects through how these changes affect premium tax credits.  as a 
result, we use a method that deals with this issue. 
 
to estimate the effect of changes in the consumers net premium on plan choice decisions, we use an 
instrumental variables approach.  we first construct a simulated 2016 net premium of the consumers

2015 selected plan as the 2016 gross premium less the consumers 2015 aptc, which is unaffected by 
changes in the consumers income or family size between 2015 and 2016.  at the same time, there is 
substantial stability across plan years in terms of aptcs.  we then use the change between the 2015 net 
premium and the 2016 simulated net premium as an instrument for the change in the net premium 
between 2015 and 2016 in our analysis.v  the results of this statistical analysis are reported in appendix 
table 2.  as in the county-level analysis, we report the results of two specifications: one in which the 
difference in premiums is measured in levels and one in which this difference is measured in percentage 
terms.  
 
c.   findings 
 
the likelihood that consumers switched plans in 2016 was highly sensitive to changes in net 
premiums and was not sensitive to changes in gross premiums, based on the results of our 
statistical model. 
 
this result is illustrated in table 4 and in figure 2.  in both, we first report the estimated percent 
increase in the individual-level switching rate in response to a $50 increase in the gross premium with 
the net premium not increasing at all (which could occur, for example, if the benchmark premium 
increased by the same amount as the consumers 2015 premium).  second, we report the estimated 
change in the individual-level switching rate in response to a $50 increase in both the gross and net 
premium (which could occur, for example, if the consumers 2015 premium increased but the 
benchmark premium did not change).vi  
 
in 2016, the average individual-level switching rate was 21.5%.  the results show that the switching rate 
was substantially higher  7.4 percentage points higher  among individuals whose net premiums 
increased by $50.  by contrast, the results show that the switching rate was not higher among individuals 
whose gross premiums increased but whose net premiums did not change.

1.002 with a standard error of 0.001.  the coefficient from the first-stage regression of the percent change in simulated net 
premiums on the percent change in net premiums is 0.138 with a standard error of 0.005. 
vi these estimates are based on the specification, reported in appendix table 2, in which we measure changes in premiums in 
levels.  we once again prefer this specification because premiums net of tax credits are designed to remain constant only if 
benchmark premiums increase by the same amount, in dollar terms, as the increase in premiums.

the findings presented in table 4 and in figure 2, once again, are consistent with consumers being 
sensitive to the net premium rather than to the gross premium when making health plan choices in 2016.   
 
iii.  conclusions 
 
in this brief, we examine whether there is evidence that consumers responded to gross premiums, rather 
than to net premiums, when making plan choice decisions in 2016.  we find little evidence to support 
the idea that consumers responded to changes in gross premiums during the 2016 open enrollment 
period.   
 
in 2017, the increases in average premiums were substantial in many parts of the country and tended to 
be much larger than in 2016.vii  however, because benchmark premiums increased substantially as well, 
we expect that most consumers will see little change in their premiums net of tax credits.  the findings 
presented in this brief suggest that consumers will respond to the change in their net premium, not to 
changes in the premium without taking into account tax credits.
