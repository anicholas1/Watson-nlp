evidence indicates a range of challenges for puerto rico health care system 

january 12, 2017 

 
the 3.5 million americans living in the commonwealth of puerto rico do not have access to a 
health care system considered standard in the rest of the nation. news reports in recent years 
describe hospitals laying off employees and closing wings, medical centers suspending or 
limiting health care services such as operating room hours, and air ambulance suppliers 
suspending services.1 concerns about the public health infrastructure in puerto rico were 
heightened this year after outbreaks of zika virus in the area. to better understand the state of 
health care in puerto rico, the office of the assistant secretary for planning and evaluation 
(aspe) supported an environmental scan2 and site visit,3 conducted an analysis of available data, 
and synthesized information and observations across u.s. department of health and human 
services (hhs) operating and staff divisions that work most closely with the commonwealth. 
despite limited data availability, we found trends that raise concerns about the puerto rico 
health care system infrastructure and workforce, prevalence of certain chronic diseases, and 
metrics of access to services and quality of care. the system shows some indications of stability, 
but evidence regarding a declining physician workforce, overcrowded hospitals with emergency 
department patients waiting nearly 13 hours from arrival to admission, and higher rates of self-
reported fair or poor health suggest a need for attention.  
 
key findings  
economic context 

 

in 2015, puerto ricos median household income was 36 percent of that in the 50 states 
and the district of columbia ($19,350 compared with $53,889); its poverty rate was 
nearly four times that of the 50 states and d.c. (41 percent compared with 12 percent of 
people with incomes below the federal poverty level [fpl], respectively). 

  puerto rico experienced a net population loss of 61,000 in 2015; the population declined 

by 6.8 percent (251,000 residents) between 2010 and 2015. this decline included a 
substantial drop in the educated and working-age (ages 20 to 65) population.  

  per capita, total health expenditures for the commonwealths population were $3,065 in 

2014, compared to $9,403 on the u.s. mainland.  

 
workforce 

  physicians have been leaving puerto rico for at least the last five years; in 2015 alone, 

approximately 500 physicians left the island according to the puerto rico college of 
physicians.

  puerto rico has less than half the rates of emergency physicians; neurosurgeons; 

orthopedists and hand surgeons; plastic surgeons; and ear, nose, and throat specialists, 
compared to the availability of these providers on the u.s. mainland. in 2015, it had only 
one pediatric anesthesiologist, two pediatric allergists, six hand surgeons, and eight 
colorectal surgeons.   

  the health resources and services administration (hrsa) has deemed 72 of puerto 

ricos 78 municipalities as medically underserved areas. for example, only 90 
obstetricians/gynecologists assist in childbirths, resulting in an estimated ratio of 400 
births per obstetrician each year, or more than one birth per doctor per day.4 in the 
mainland u.s., hrsa estimates the comparable ratio of births per obstetrician each year 
is roughly half.5  

 
access and service use 

  approximately 94 percent of puerto ricos residents had health insurance in 2014. nearly 

half of residents are covered by medicaid, chip, or low-income coverage funded by 
puerto rico-only dollars. unlike medicaid programs in the mainland u.s., federal funding 
for puerto ricos medicaid program is capped. 

  long wait times are a persistent challenge, including a median wait time of nearly 13 

hours between arrival and admission and the need to wait up to nine months for 
appointments with certain categories of specialists and some as long as 12 hours and 58 
minutes in emergency departments between arrival and admission. 

  people in puerto rico are less likely to receive certain types of preventive care, as 

evidenced by lower rates of colorectal cancer screenings for those ages 50-75 (52.5 
percent) than the u.s. mainland (66.4 percent) and pap tests for those ages 21-65 (77.4 
percent, compared to 82.6 percent), but are more likely to have a mammogram (82.3 
percent, compared to 78.1 percent). 

  puerto rico has one-quarter the number of intensive care unit hospital beds per person 

compared to the mainland u.s. (70.1 per 1 million people, compared with 290.6 beds per 
1 million on the mainland u.s.). 

  puerto rico does not have any burn unit beds in its hospitals.  
  the rate of puerto ricans receiving a flu shot in the last year was 12 percent lower than 

that of the mainland u.s. population.  

  access to treatment considered to be the standard of care falls far short of mainland 

standards. while ninety-four percent of acute myocardial infarction patients in puerto 
rico receive aspirin within 24 hours before their emergency department arrival or during 
their stay (compared to 99.1 percent of those in the mainland u.s.), only 54 percent 
receive percutaneous coronary intervention within 90 minutes, compared to 93.1 percent 
of patients who receive this level of care in the mainland u.s. 

 
health indicators 

  puerto ricans are twice as likely to suffer from coronary heart disease as the general u.s. 

population. rates of myocardial infarction, asthma, and high blood pressure are also 
higher in puerto rico than on the u.s. mainland. 
in 2015, life expectancy was similar for residents of puerto rico (79.25 years) and the 
u.s. mainland (79.68 years).

  puerto rico has a higher infant mortality rate than the u.s. mainland (7.57 per 1,000 in 
2015 compared to 5.87 per 1,000), and a premature birth rate well above the average for 
the u.s. mainland (11.8 percent in puerto rico versus 9.6 percent on the mainland).  

  self-reported health status is far worse in puerto rico, with adults reporting higher rates of 

fair or poor health (35.4 percent compared to 17.9 percent in 2014).  

 
in this report, we describe the demographic and economic contexts in which health care delivery 
in puerto rico operates. we then examine the infrastructure in the commonwealth, including 
facilities such as hospitals, as well as the critical issue of physician supply. subsequent sections 
discuss health insurance coverage, access and service use, prevalence of disease, and health 
outcomes and quality. this assessment does not attempt to infer the causes of any issues, nor 
does it propose policy solutions. it merely captures the best information available about the 
health of americans living in puerto rico and the system in place to deliver care and maintain 
their health and well-being. 

demographic and economic contexts 
the archipelago of puerto rico includes one main islandwhere the vast majority of the 
population livesand six smaller islands, comprising 78 municipalities in all.6

economic decline. in 2014, puerto ricos real gross domestic product (gdp) was $103.1 
billion, down from $112 billion in 2005. puerto ricos economy relied on three major industrial 
sectors: manufacturing (46.5 percent of gdp), services (41.6 percent), and government (8 
percent).8 the decline in puerto ricos gdp has been accompanied by a 9 percent decline in 
labor force participation (1.29 million in 2010 to 1.18 million in 2014) and a 7 percent decline in 
employment (1.08 million in 2010 down to 1.01 million in 2014).9 the unemployment rate in

puerto rico11.9 percent in november 2016has consistently exceeded the unemployment 
rate of the u.s. overall4.6 percent in november 2016.10 in 2015, puerto ricos median 
household income was 36 percent of that in the 50 states and d.c. ($19,350 compared with 
$53,889 in the mainland u.s.), and its poverty rate was nearly four times that of the u.s. overall 
(41.8 percent, compared with 11.3 percent of families with incomes below the fpl in the 
mainland u.s.).11 
 
the ongoing economic decline of puerto rico has been exacerbated by the commonwealth 
governments debt burden.12, 13, 14 puerto rico currently has $72 billion in debt and, unlike any 
u.s. state government, cannot authorize its municipalities and public corporations to declare 
bankruptcy as a means of restructuring its debt.15 budget cuts have substantially reduced 
education, health care, and social services.16  
 
population changes. puerto rico experienced a net population loss of 61,000 in 2015, and the 
population declined by 6.8 percent (251,000 residents) between 2010 and 2015.17 one source 
projects that the island may lose another 500,000 people by 2050.18 the current emigration flows 
now exceed those of the great migrationthe period between 1946 and 1960 when 605,450 
puerto ricansan average of 40,000 a yearleft the islands to settle on the u.s. mainland. 19 
emigration flows have been distributed unevenly across the population, leading to a substantial 
decline in the educated and working-age (ages 20 to 65) population.20 the average person 
leaving puerto rico is 29 years oldyounger than those staying in or immigrating to puerto 
rico. more than 50 percent of emigrants are men (53 percent), speak english well or very well 
(65 percent), have graduated from high school (75 percent), and live above the poverty level (58 
percent).  
 
health care spending. from 2010 to 2014, puerto ricos total public and private health care 
expenditures decreased by 10 percent, from $12.1 billion to $10.9 billion. per capita, total health 
expenditures for the commonwealths population declined by 5 percent, from $3,240 in 2010 to 
$3,065 in 2014;21 in the mainland u.s., per capita health expenditures were $9,515.22 (see figure 
2.) as of 2014, the health sector made up approximately 10.5 percent and 17.4 percent of gdp in 
puerto rico and the mainland u.s., respectively.23

health infrastructure 
puerto ricos department of health (departamento de salud, or ds) administers the islands 
public health programs and services. the health insurance administration of puerto rico 
(administracin de seguros de salud de puerto rico, or ases) administers the government 
health insurance plani (ghip) and directly contracts with managed care organizations and other 
health care providers through a cooperative agreement with the ds. the government health 
plan includes the commonwealths medicaid program, childrens health insurance program 
(chip), dually eligible medicare-medicaid beneficiaries, and coverage funded by puerto rico-
only dollars. 24 all public employees also receive their health coverage through the ghp. both 
the ds and the ases organize their services by geographic regions: east/mayagez-aguadilla, 
northeast/arecibo, southeast-southwest/ponce, west/caguas, northwest/fajardo-vieques-
culebra, southwest/bayamn, and north-san juan/metro. however, the municipalities within 
these ds and ases regions do not completely coincide with one another.ii 
 
hospitals. in 2015, puerto rico had 2.68 beds per 1,000 people, and the mainland u.s. had 2.90 
beds per 1,000 people. in total, puerto rico had 64 hospitals, compared to 6,187 registered 
hospitals in the mainland u.s.; 25 figure 3 displays their locations. more than half of them are 
for-profit and one-third are nonprofit. in contrast, about a quarter of all u.s. hospitals are for-
profit and half are nonprofit (table 1).iii one significant difference between hospitals in puerto 
rico and the mainland u.s. is their size. puerto rico has more mid-size hospitals than does the 
mainland. about half of puerto ricos hospitals have between 100 and 199 beds, whereas only a 
fifth of u.s. hospitals fall into that category. puerto rico also does not have any very large 
hospitals, defined as having 500 beds or more; in contrast, 5 percent of u.s. hospitals fall into 
this category (table 2).

the breakdown of hospitals by their primary focus is similar in puerto rico and the mainland 
u.s. aha survey data show that about three-quarters of all hospitals in puerto rico and the 
mainland are general medical/surgical hospitals. the remainder consists of a variety of specialty 
hospitals, including psychiatric, cancer, and childrens hospitals. (table 3).

another major difference between hospitals in puerto rico and the mainland u.s. is the extent of 
their affiliation with a system. puerto rico hospitals tend to be more decentralized than those in 
the mainland. about 79.7 percent of puerto rico hospitals are not part of a larger organization. 
in comparison, 36.5 percent of u.s. hospitals fall into this category (table 4).

considerable variation in hospital and bed capacity exists across the commonwealths seven ds 
health care regions. puerto ricos most populous region, the san juan metro area, has the largest 
share of the commonwealths hospitals (33.9 percent) and hospital beds (39.7 percent). the san 
juan metro area has the second-lowest ratio of hospitals to residents (one hospital for every 
42,455 inhabitants) and the highest rate of hospital beds per 1,000 residents (4.2). in contrast, the 
bayamn region, just outside of the san juan metro area, has a hospital-to-resident ratio of one 
for every 150,415 inhabitants and 1.3 hospital beds per 1,000 residents (table 5). in the

according to the american college of emergency physicians 2014 americas emergency care 
environment state-by-state report card, puerto rico had only 70.1 intensive care unit beds per 
1 million people, compared with 290.6 beds per 1 million people in the mainland u.s. puerto 
rico also does not have any burn unit beds in its hospitals. the report notes, what few data are 
available  provide evidence of a limited infrastructure for responding quickly and effectively 
in the event of a disaster or mass casualty event.27  

puerto rico does not have a long-term care sector similar to the mainland u.s. care for seniors 
generally is provided by family members, family-financed home-based caregivers, private senior 
care entities (some of which specialize in dementia care), and through commonwealth licensed 
homes for seniors.  

health centers. hrsa provides more than $91.2 million in competitive awards to support 20 
health centers in puerto rico that operate at 85 sites in the commonwealth (figure 4). in 2015, 
these sites served 346,702 patients with the following characteristics: 

  29.6 percent were children (under the age of 18)  
  96.9 percent of all patients were at/below 200 percent of the federal poverty level 
  68 percent had medicaid or chip 
  10 percent had private insurance 
  9 percent had medicare

based on 2015 health center grantee data, approximately 10 percent of the population in puerto 
rico receives care from health centers versus 7.5 percent in the 50 states plus d.c. however, the 
health centers in puerto rico have a higher percentage of medical care visits and a much lower 
percentage of dental care visits than do those in the 50 states plus d.c, although it is unclear 
which puerto rico health centers offer dental services. anecdotally, hrsa staff have heard that 
in many areas, health centers are the only locally accessible primary care providers and often the 
largest employer in the communities they serve.

education, including an estimated 2,132 health professionals.28 hrsa has deemed 72 of puerto 
ricos 78 municipalities as medically underserved areas and has identified 32 primary care 
health provider shortage areas. 

according to the association of american medical colleges (aamc), puerto rico had 8,195 
active physicians who engaged in patient care in 2014 (230.9 physicians per 100,000 
inhabitants). primary care physicians made up about 44 percent of that total, and general 
surgeons 2 percent. puerto ricos supply of physicians and general surgeons closely parallels 
that of the mainland u.s., but puerto rico has more primary care physicians per 100,000 
inhabitants (table 6).29,30

the american college of emergency physicians 2014 americas emergency care 
environment, state-by-state report card noted that puerto rico has less than half the number of 
emergency physicians; neurosurgeons; orthopedists and hand surgeons; plastic surgeons; and ear, 
nose, and throat specialists than the mainland u.s. as a share of the population.31 according to 
another report, puerto rico has only one pediatric anesthesiologist, two pediatric allergists, six 
hand surgeons, and eight colorectal surgeons.32 there also are reportedly only 90 
obstetricians/gynecologists, resulting in an estimated a ratio of 400 births per obstetrician each 
year, or one birth per doctor per day. the same report found that in 2005, 1,485 pediatricians 
were registered as part of the workforce, whereas in 2014 only 812 were actively practicing.  

migration of physicians. hhs agencies that work in puerto rico, news reports, and anecdotes 
universally cite the declining supply of physicians as a primary concern. table 7 lists estimates 
of the outmigration of physicians reported by various publications; note, however, that based on 
the aamc data in table 6, the number of physicians (both primary care and specialty) actually 
appears to have increased as a share of the population between 2012 and 2014. if both these data 
and reports of physicians leaving puerto rico are accurate, the discrepancy is likely due to a 
faster decrease in the overall population than that of physicians. however, we do not have more 
recent data from the aamc to assess whether the trend shown in table 6 has continued in more 
recent years.

health insurance coverage 
most of puerto ricos residents have some form of health insuranceabout 94 percent in 2014, 
compared with 88 percent on the u.s. mainland (figure 5). almost two-thirds of puerto ricos 
population had public coverage in 2014, which is significantly higher than the public coverage 
rate on the u.s. mainland (29 percent). puerto ricos high medicaid coverage drove most of this 
difference, with 49 percent of the commonwealth population covered by medicaid or chip; 
only 19 percent of the u.s. mainland received medicaid or chip coverage in the same year. as 
of september 2016, there were more than 1.5 million people enrolled in medicaid or chip and 
740,000 people covered by medicare.iv

medicaid and chip. puerto rico generally has lower eligibility levels for its medicaid program 
compared to the u.s. mainland. first, puerto rico does not provide medicaid coverage to all 
federally mandated populations.37 second, puerto rico uses a local poverty level to establish 
income-based eligibility for medicaid ($413.53 per month for an individual). puerto rico 
provides coverage to individuals with modified adjusted gross incomes up to 133 percent of the 
puerto rico poverty level (prpl) for medicaid and 266 percent of prpl for chip. in 2016 for 
medicaid, this is $850 per month for a family of four, or approximately 56 percent of fpl. table 
8 shows, by family size, the monthly income at which people in puerto rico qualify for

because puerto ricans are u.s. citizens, they would be eligible for medicaid in the states to 
which they move if they otherwise qualify based on that state's eligibility requirements, as would 
be true for any low-income u.s. citizen moving between two states. 

federal funding for puerto rico's medicaid program differs from that of the u.s. mainland in 
two significant ways. first, puerto rico's federal medicaid match rate for medical assistance 
(federal medical assistance percentage, or fmap) is a fixed rate of 55 percent set by statute. 
for state medicaid programs, a statutory formula determines a states fmap, which can range 
between a minimum fmap of 50 percent and a maximum fmap of 83 percent. if calculated by 

 aspe office of health policy 

 

january 12, 2017 

aspe issue brief                                                                                                                   page 13 

the same statutory formula used for the 50 states and d.c., puerto ricos fmap would be 83 
percent, although the unbounded fmap would be 93.34 percent.  

second, federal funding for puerto rico's medicaid program is capped. for federal fiscal year 
(ffy) 2014, the federal medicaid cap was $321.3 million, ffy 2015 was $329 million, ffy 
2016 was $335.3, and ffy 2017 is $347.4 million. unlike the 50 states and d.c., where the 
federal government will match all medicaid expenditures at the appropriate federal medical 
assistance percentage (fmap) for that state, in puerto rico, the fmap is applied until the 
medicaid ceiling funds and the affordable care act available funds are exhausted.   due to these 
federal funding constraints, puerto rico has placed limits on certain services typically provided 
under medicaid.38 

the affordable care act (aca), in addition to raising puerto ricos fmap, provided two 
additional sources of new funding for its medicaid program. first, the aca gave puerto rico an 
additional $5.4 billion in federal medicaid funding, to be spent between 2011 and 2019. second, 
puerto rico received $925 million in lieu of funds the commonwealth would have received to 
provide private insurance subsidies through a health insurance marketplace, but these funds can 
be accessed only after the $5.4 billion is spent and are available only through calendar year 
2019. puerto rico is projected to spend both the $5.4 billion and the $925 million as early as by 
the end of the first quarter of fy 2018. hhs analysis estimates that nearly 900,000 people in 
puerto rico could lose their health insurance when that funding expires. 

in fy 2015, puerto rico provided coverage for 10 of the medicaid programs 17 federally 
mandated benefits. table 9 below shows which services are covered by puerto ricos medicaid 
program.

medicare. puerto ricans pay the same medicare payroll taxes as citizens on the u.s. mainland, 
but spending per puerto rican enrollee is lower than that for any state.39 puerto rico's per capita 
medicare spending is $5,230significantly less than the national average of $9,501.40  
 
the most significant difference between the designs of medicare part b in puerto rico and on 
the u.s. mainland is the approach to enrollment. in puerto rico, medicare beneficiaries must opt 
in to part b. on the u.s. mainland, medicare automatically enrolls beneficiaries in part b, who 
can then opt out of this program. if medicare beneficiaries do not enroll in part b at the time of 
initial eligibility, they are subject to penalties if they ultimately enroll at a later date. since puerto 
rican residents have to actively opt into part b, they are more likely to enroll in part b late and 
incur penalties.  residents currently incur more than $7 million per year in late enrollment 
penalties, and a greater proportion of puerto rican medicare beneficiaries are covered by part a 
but not part b than on the u.s. mainland (18 percent versus 8 percent in 2012).41 puerto rico 
does not have a program to help low-income medicare beneficiaries pay their part b premiums 
(known as the medicare savings program) for individuals who are not eligible for other 
medicaid benefits. thus, if automatic enrollment were to be implemented in puerto rico, many 
low-income residents of puerto rico would likely still opt out of part b due to not being able to 
afford the premiums.  
 
the overwhelming majority of puerto ricans enrolled in medicare (more than 70 percent) elect 
to receive medicare benefits through medicare advantage, which delivers medicare benefits 
through private managed care plans. in contrast, only about 30 percent of u.s. mainland 
beneficiaries enroll in these plans. medicare advantage plans in puerto rico, as on the u.s. 
mainland, often subsidize medicare's part b premium and have lower cost-sharing than does 
traditional medicare, which has made these plans particularly attractive to low-income puerto 
rican medicare beneficiaries.42   
 
the current methodology for setting provider payments under medicare part a is largely the 
same for acute care hospitals in puerto rico and on the u.s. mainland. differences between the 
two payment methodologies include adjustments for low-volume hospitals, sole community 
hospitals, and medicare-dependent hospitals, as well as adjustments for quality programs (e.g., 
the hospital-acquired condition reduction program, the hospital readmissions reduction 
program, and the hospital value-based purchasing program)none of which are available to 
puerto rico hospitals. like hospitals located on the u.s. mainland, puerto rico hospitals receive 
graduate medical education payments and disproportionate share payments under medicare. 
however, puerto rican residents are ineligible for supplemental security income (ssi), which is 
used to calculate the medicare disproportionate share payment.  
 
medicare inpatient payment rates are adjusted by an area wage index to reflect the expected 
differences in local market prices for labor. the wage index is applied to the labor-related 
portion of the base rate (usually called the labor share), which reflects an estimate of the 
portion of costs affected by local wage rates and fringe benefits. the centers for medicare & 
medicaid services (cms) current operating labor share estimate of 69.6 percent is applied to 
hospitals with a wage index above 1.0.  hospitals located in areas with a wage index less than or 
equal to 1.0 can receive an operating labor share of 62 percent ; this provision applies to puerto 
rico, as there are no areas in the commonwealth with a national wage index greater than 1.0 for 
fy 2017.

in the calendar year 2017 medicare physician fee schedule final rule, cms aligned puerto ricos 
geographic practice cost index methodology with those of the u.s. virgin islands by setting 
puerto ricos gpci using the national average. puerto rico had been the only territory whose 
geographic adjustment was based on available territory-specific data, which historically led to 
significantly lower medicare physician fee schedule payments  in puerto rico than all other 
territories. 
 
the issues described above related to traditional medicare payment rates in puerto rico and 
payment reductions included in the aca contribute to the differential spending in puerto rico as 
compared to the u.s. mainland as well as lower ma rates in puerto rico. however, cms 
announced that in 2017 it will implement several changes to the 2017 rate announcement which 
will benefit medicare advantage enrollees in puerto rico, such as adjusting risk scores to reflect 
the higher costs of individuals enrolled in both medicare and medicaid, incorporating increased 
hospital payments, and adjusting the fee-for-service experience to reflect the propensity of zero 
dollar claimants nationwide, rather than the propensity of zero dollar claimants solely in puerto 
rico. cms will also adjust the star rating system for quality bonus payments to account for 
enrollees socioeconomic status and ineligibility for the low-income subsidy program; these 
changes are expected to modestly increase payments to medicare advantage plans operating in 
puerto rico.43 
 
while the medicare part d program generally functions similarly in puerto rico and on the u.s. 
mainland, one exception is the low-income subsidies program, which is available only on the 
u.s. mainland. in its place, the medicare modernization act provided funds for an enhanced 
allotment plan to cover prescription drugs for people dually eligible for medicare and medicaid.  
 
private insurance. private insurance, which includes employer-sponsored coverage and 
individual market coverage, is less common in puerto rico than on the u.s. mainland. 
approximately 34 percent of puerto rican residents had employer-sponsored coverage or direct-
purchase health insurance in 2014, compared to 59 percent on the u.s. mainland.44 

access and service use 
puerto rican adults experience better access to care than those on the u.s. mainland in certain 
domains after controlling for economic and demographic factors, including race/ethnicity, age, 
sex, household income, educational attainment, urban/rural residence, marital status, and 
employment. at the same time, some evidence suggests lack of access to some services.  
 
hhs agencies working in and with the commonwealth observe patients needing to travel great 
distances to access services. for example, hrsa reports, the availability and accessibility of 
more tertiary-level services such as audiology, ophthalmology, orthopedics, and gastroenterology 
varies greatly by region. the only regional pediatric center (rpc) that offers tertiary-level care 
and specialty services such as neurosurgery, plastic surgery, ear, nose, and throat, neural tube 
defects, and craniofacial anomalies, is the metropolitan rpc in san juan, placing challenges 
on children and families in other areas of puerto rico that require more specialty care. the 
assistant secretary for preparedness and response notes that there is only one trauma center in 
puerto rico. its san juan location means that residents on the western side of the island must

travel approximately 120 miles to receive specialized trauma care. hhs also has received reports 
of patients traveling for more than two hours to get treatment. 
 
agencies across hhs also report long wait times for visits and procedures. moreover, the 
american college of emergency physicians 2014 americas emergency care environment 
state-by-state report card cites excessively long wait times in emergency departments. it 
reports a median wait time of 778 minutes (almost 13 hours) from emergency department arrival 
to departure, meaning that patients can expect to wait 13 hours to be admitted into a hospital 
room.45 this is compared to 272 minutes (4.5 hours) on average in the u.s. and 452 minutes (7.5 
hours) in d.c., the lowest-performing in the mainland u.s.46 in 2015, ases executive director 
ricardo rivera indicated that specialty services have exceptionally long wait timesas many as 
nine months for some specialties.47 
 
despite these challenges with access to care, puerto rico residents also were more likely to have 
a usual source of care and a check-up within the past year and less likely to have experienced 
cost-related delays, compared to their counterparts on the u.s. mainland.48 an hhs analysis 
found that puerto ricans were less likely to refrain from seeing a doctor because of cost in the 
past year but were more likely to refrain from taking medication due to cost, compared to the 
mainland u.s.  
 
specific services and screenings. as shown in table 10, data from the behavioral risk factor 
surveillance system (brfss) comparing puerto rico to the rest of the u.s. show that 
americans in puerto rico are less likely to receive colorectal cancer screenings and pap smears.

patient being diagnosed with aids within a year of his or her hiv diagnosisindicate that there 
may be a gap in early hiv detection in puerto rico. from 2010 to 2011, about half of the 
patients studied presented for care late, which can result in higher transmission, lower 
effectiveness of treatment, and worse outcomes. these results are consistent with another study 
that suggests that gay men in san juan receive hiv testing less frequently than recommended by 
the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc).53 
 
the american college of emergency physicians 2014 americas emergency care environment 
state-by-state report card discusses treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction 
(ami). though it found that a high proportion of patients in puerto rico (94 percent) receive 
aspirin within 24 hours before their emergency department arrival or during their stay (compared 
with 99.1 percent in the mainland u.s.), only 54 percent receive percutaneous coronary 
intervention within 90 minutesan increase from 17 percent in 2009, but well below the 93.1 
percent of patients that receive this level of care in the mainland u.s. 
 
immunization and vaccination. evidence shows that puerto ricos immunization and 
vaccination rates are low relative to the u.s. mainland. puerto ricos department of health 
notes that in 2014, 56.4 percent of children from 19 to 35 months received all their recommended 
vaccines, compared with 71.6 percent of children the same age in the mainland u.s.54  
 
influenza and pneumonia immunization rates also are lower. one study found that 25.5 percent 
of puerto rican medicare beneficiaries received a pneumonia immunization in 2008, whereas 
the rate for spanish-preferring medicare beneficiaries on the u.s. mainland was almost double 
(47.4 percent).55 similarly, influenza immunization rates among medicare beneficiaries living in 
puerto rico were lower (32.7 percent) than spanish-preferring and english-preferring medicare 
beneficiaries living on the u.s. mainland (67.7 and 73.3 percent, respectively).56 during the 
20132014 influenza season, 18 percent of puerto ricans reported receiving the influenza 
vaccination, compared to 46 percent on the u.s. mainland.57 for the 20142015 season, the 
puerto rico department of health reported that 15 percent of the elderly population received the 
flu shot.58 moreover, an hhs analysis of federal data found that the puerto rico population 
receiving a flu shot in the past year was 12 percent lower than the mainland u.s. population.  
 
an urban institute analysis of brfss data found that the 2014 influenza vaccination rate among 
adults in puerto rico was also lower than that of adults in florida and mississippi or the rest of 
the u.s. mainland (table 11). similarly, the american college of emergency physicians 2014 
americas emergency care environment state-by-state report card noted declining 
immunization rates among older adults in puerto rico, with only 28.6 percent of the elderly 
reporting receiving an influenza vaccination in the past year, and fewer than 23 percent reporting 
ever having received a pneumococcal vaccine.59

one study of human papillomavirus vaccine (hpv) vaccination in puerto rico found that only 
21 percent of girls ages 11 to 18 had completed a full vaccination series.60 on the u.s. mainland, 
in contrast, 63 percent of girls and 50 percent of boys ages 13 to 17 received the hpv

behavioral health services. there is limited information on availability of behavioral health 
services in puerto rico, but medical services generally are more widely available than behavioral 
health services. patients with behavioral health problems often seek care from primary care 
providers and at non-psychiatric hospitals.62 psychological services also are typically not 
provided in the commonwealths general hospitals. an hhs analysis indicates that mental 
health visits account for a smaller percentage of puerto rico health center visits than in health 
centers on the u.s. mainland.  

prevalence of disease 
brfss data show a higher disease burden for several chronic conditions and associated risk 
factors. for example, puerto ricans are twice as likely to suffer from coronary heart disease as 
the general u.s. population. rates of myocardial infarction, asthma, and high blood pressure are 
also higher in puerto rico than on the u.s. mainland.

in its 2015 puerto rico primary care needs assessment, the puerto rico department of health 
reported the incidence of several conditions compared with the u.s. mainland. the department 
found that from 2008 to 2012, puerto rico had a lower age-adjusted incidence rate for all cancer 
sites, colon and rectum cancer, and female breast cancer, but higher rates for prostate cancer, 
hiv, and syphilis. (see table 13 and figure 7 below.)63

according to 2013 data, the causes of death in puerto rico include cancer, diseases of the heart, 
diabetes, alzheimers disease, and cerebrovascular diseases (table 14).64 in comparison, the top 
five causes of death in the mainland u.s. were diseases of the heart, cancer, chronic respiratory 
diseases, unintentional injuries, and cerebrovascular diseases.65 the second and third most 
common causes of death in puerto ricodiabetes and alzheimers diseasewere slightly lower 
in the u.s. mainland rankings, where they ranked sixth and seventh, respectively, in 2013 (23.9 
per 100,000 and 26.8 per 100,000).66

due to the aging of puerto ricos population, crude death rates for diabetes and alzheimers 
disease have been rising over the past five years. however, adjusted for the changing age 
distribution in puerto rico, death rates for most leading causes of death have fallen.67 

health indicators 
a recent study found that, across 17 quality measures, hispanic medicare advantage enrollees in 
puerto rico had significantly worse performance on 15 of those measures than hispanic 
enrollees residing in the mainland u.s.68 an older study also found that medicare beneficiaries 
in puerto rico experience lower quality of care than u.s. mainland residents on more than 20 
process measures.69 
 
health indicators provide important information in assessing the effectiveness and success of a 
health system. the best available indications of health outcomes in puerto rico are metrics on 
life expectancy, infant mortality, and self-reported health status. in two of the three, puerto rico 
is worse off than the u.s. mainland. puerto rico has a higher infant mortality rate (7.57 per 
1,000 in 2015) than the u.s. mainland (5.87 per 1,000 in 2015) and a premature birth rate well 
above the average for the u.s. mainland (11.8 percent in puerto rico versus 9.6 percent in the 
u.s.).70 adults in puerto rico report higher rates of fair or poor health (35.4 percent, compared 
to 17.9 percent in 2014).71 in 2015, life expectancy was similar for residents of puerto rico 
(79.25 years) and the u.s. mainland (79.68 years).72  

conclusion 
the information compiled here suggests distress in the puerto rico health care system even 
before new public health challenges, such as the zika virus. though not addressed in this report, 
the prevalence of the zika virus in puerto rico stands to increase the strain on its health care 
services and infrastructure. in puerto rico, as of december 14, 2016, there were more than 
33,000 cases of local zika transmission.73 cdc projects that a quarter of the islands population 
may be infected with zika in the first year of its presence and already, over 3000 pregnant 
women have been infected. for a system that has a shortage of obstetrician/gynecologists and 
developmental pediatricians, and lacks a long-term care service infrastructure, the implications 
of zika for affected mothers and babies is of concern.  the zika response and preparedness act 
(p.l. 114-223), signed on september 28, 2016, authorized $933 million in appropriations to hhs 
to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the zika virus in puerto rico, other u.s. territories, and 
the u.s. mainland. 
 
available evidence clearly indicates a shortage of specialists, and anecdotal evidence suggests a 
significant emigration of health care professionals to the u.s. mainland. although the vast 
majority of citizens in puerto rico have health insurance, the imminent exhaustion of additional 
federal funding threatens that safety net, with nearly 900,000 people potentially losing coverage. 
even those with health insurance must travel great distances and experience long wait times to 
access care. moreover, puerto rico is underperforming in some important services, such as 
cancer screening and immunizations. perhaps as a result, the rate of adults in fair to poor health 
is twice as high in puerto rico than in the mainland u.s. the evidence also shows that there are 
areas where the system seems to be adequate, and life expectancy rates are about the same as in 
the mainland u.s.

timely data are difficult to obtain, and additional studies certainly would aid in better 
understanding the implications of puerto ricos health system for the health and well-being of 
the american citizens living there. nevertheless, this report synthesizes available information 
about the health care delivery system on which these 3.5 million americans depend. the 
evidence presented here suggests real challenges. from an enduring economic crisis to 
underlying statutory disparities, puerto rico faces a combination of unique circumstances that 
not only hinder improvement but risk further deterioration.
