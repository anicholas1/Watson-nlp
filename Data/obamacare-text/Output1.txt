continuing progress on the opioid epidemic: 

the role of the affordable care act 

january 11, 2017 

 
the united states is experiencing an unprecedented epidemic of opioid use disorder and 
overdose. in 2015, more than 33,000 americans died of an overdose involving a prescription or 
illicit opioid, and more than 2 million individuals had an opioid use disorder. in partnership with 
state and local governments, healthcare professionals, and other key stakeholders, hhs launched 
its opioid initiative in march 2015 and has taken significant steps to: 1) improve opioid 
prescribing practices; 2) increase the use of naloxone to reverse opioid overdoses; and 3) expand 
access to and the provision of medication-assisted treatment with methadone, buprenorphine, or 
naltrexone  in combination with appropriate psychosocial services.1 the department has also 
continued to prioritize reducing stigma and advancing prevention, treatment, and parity for 
people needing care for mental health and substance use disorders. 
 
the success of these strategies  especially the third  rests on a base of health insurance 
coverage. what that means is that our nations best shot at reversing the opioid epidemic and 
providing needed care for opioid use disorders, others substance use disorders, and mental illness  
depends on the continued success of the affordable care act (aca).   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

key findings  
  the share of hospitalizations for substance use or mental health disorders in which the 
patient was uninsured fell from 22 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013 (just before the 
acas major coverage provisions took effect) to about 14 percent by the end of 2014.   

  the top three  west virginia, new hampshire, and kentucky  would see 
their uninsured rates nearly or more than triple if the aca were repealed, as 
would massachusetts.  

  between 2010 and 2015, the share of people foregoing mental health care due to cost 

has fallen by about one-third for people below 400 percent of the federal poverty level. 

o  in states that expanded medicaid under the aca, the uninsured share of 

substance use or mental health disorder hospitalizations fell from about 20 
percent in the fourth quarter of 2013 to about 5 percent by mid-2015.   

  the states with the highest drug overdose deaths also are projected to experience 

dramatic increases in their uninsured rates if the aca were repealed:

increasing coverage, access to care 
over 20 million americans have gained coverage as a result of the aca, driving the share of 
americans without health insurance to the lowest level in history.2,3 among those gaining 
coverage have been millions of americans who need treatment for opioid use disorders, other 
substance use disorders, or other behavioral health conditions.  
 
evidence suggests this coverage expansion has improved access to care and outcomes for   
americans with opioid or other substance use or mental health disorders. for example, 
hospitalization data provide strong evidence of substantial coverage gains. figure 1a. shows that, 
across all states for which data are available, the share of hospitalizations for substance use or 
mental health disorders in which the patient was uninsured fell from 22 percent just before the 
acas major coverage provisions took effect in 2014 to about 14 percent by the end of 2014.  
for the subset of 17 states for which data are available through the third quarter of 2015 (2015-
q3), the uninsured share fell from 21 percent at the end of 2013 to 11 percent in 2015-q3, as 
shown in figure 1b.  
 
these coverage gains were especially pronounced in states that expanded medicaid under the 
aca. across all medicaid expansion states for which data are available, the uninsured share of 
substance use or mental health disorder hospitalizations plummeted from about 20 percent in 
2013 to around 6 percent by the end of 2014. for the 10 medicaid expansion states with data 
available through the third quarter of 2015, the uninsured share fell from 20 percent at the end of 
2013 to about 5 percent in 2015-q3.

all states with available data

 

notes: the vertical line indicates the final quarter prior to the january 1, 2014, date on which marketplace coverage took 
effect and medicaid expansion took effect in adopting states. states included here with different expansion dates are: mn 
(march 2010), ca (november 2010), nj (april 2011), co (april 2012), mo (july 2012), and mi (april 2014). for each 
group of states (expansion, non-expansion, and all), the share of uninsured hospitalizations in all hospitalizations was 
calculated as an average of individual states percentages of uninsured hospitalizations. this analysis includes states for 
which complete data are available through 2015-q3. included as medicaid-expansion states are: ca, co, hi, ia, ky, mi, 
mn, nj, ny, and or. included as non-expansion states are: fl, ga, mo, sd, tx, va, and wi. 

the same trends have occurred in the states that have been most affected by the opioid epidemic 
(see appendix). for example, in west virginia, the state with the highest drug overdose death 
rate in 2015, according to centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) data, the uninsured 
share of substance use and mental health disorder hospitalizations fell from 23 percent at the end 
of 2013 to 5 percent at the end of 2014. 
  
these data are consistent with other evidence that the acas coverage expansions have been 
especially important to people with substance use disorders and other behavioral health 
conditions. for example, aspe previously estimated that, if additional states chose to expand 
medicaid, almost 30 percent5 of those who could gain coverage have a substance use or mental 
health disorder. aspe also recently estimated6 that mental health disorders are among the most 
common pre-existing health conditions for which americans might have been denied coverage 
or charged more for coverage prior to aca.  
 
the aca also ensures that, when people with behavioral health needs gain insurance, their 
treatment is covered. prior to the aca, an estimated 34 percent7 of individual market policies

did not cover substance use treatment, and an estimated 18 percent8 did not cover treatment for 
mental health conditions. today, all coverage is required to include these essential health 
benefits. further, because of the aca and the mental health parity and addiction equity act 
(mhpaea), coverage is required to include substance use or mental health disorder benefits. 
 
how coverage affects treatment for opioid use disorder 

despite ample evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of medication-assisted treatment for 
people with opioid use disorder, the overwhelming majority of people who need treatment do not 
get it. some of the main barriers to treatment are related to cost9, insurance coverage10, and 
availability. over the past several years, hhs has worked with state and local governments and 
the provider community to expand treatment capacity11,12,13 for opioid and other substance use 
disorders. in addition, through funding included in the21st century cures act, hhs will award 
close to $1 billion dollars over the next two years to substantially expand state and local capacity 
to provide medication-assisted treatment and other services to support people with opioid use 
disorders. but even when capacity exists, patients must still be able to afford the treatment they 
need.  
 
research14 shows that health insurance coverage makes care more affordable, secure, and 
reliable15, and people with insurance are more likely to get timely care and have a usual source of 
care. nowhere is this more important than for people with an opioid use disorder or other 
substance use disorder. for these individuals, timely and affordable access to evidence-based 
treatment, including medication-assisted treatment can be life-saving.  
 
moreover, a large proportion of people with opioid use disorder are also coping with co-
occurring mental illness16, most frequently depression and anxiety17, as well as with significant 
physical health needs18. appropriate treatment of these co-occurring conditions is often critical 
to supporting an individuals long-term recovery from opioid use disorder. 
 
with the acas marketplace and medicaid expansion entering their fourth year, evidence is 
mounting19 that they are making a difference in helping people access care, including 
behavioral health care. for example:  
 

  as shown in figure 2, the share of people foregoing mental health care due to cost has 

fallen by 33 percent for people with incomes below 138 percent of the poverty level and   
by 31 percent for people with incomes above 138 and below 400 percent of the federal 
poverty level.  these populations are eligible for the acas medicaid expansion or tax 
credits.

  among low-income adults, medicaid expansion was associated with a 7.5 percent20 

reduction in unmet need for mental health treatment and an 18.3 percent21  reduction in 
unmet need for substance use disorder treatment services.  

 

 

  medicaid expansion in ohio led to especially large improvements22 in access to care and 

financial security for expansion enrollees with opioid use disorder. 75 percent reported 
improved overall access to care, 83 percent reported improved access to prescription 
medications, and 59 percent reported improved access to mental health care. 

  medicaid expansion in kentucky was linked to a large increase23 in kentuckians 

receiving treatment for substance use disorder.  

 
parity for mental health and substance use treatment has also resulted in improved access to care. 
researchers found that implementation of state-level parity laws prior to the aca increased the 
treatment rate for substance use disorders by 9 percent24 among all specialty treatment facilities 
and by 15 percent25 among treatment facilities accepting private insurance. under the aca, 
these types of parity protections have been expanded and strengthened.

in addition to directly addressing access and unmet need for patients, insurance expansion is 
motivating providers to provide treatment. a recent study26 found that states that made an early 
commitment to expand medicaid and establish insurance marketplaces had significantly higher 
growth in the number of physicians with a waiver to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use 
disorder treatment. this represents a critical first step to expanding access to mat for people 
with opioid use disorders.   
 
a number of states are also building on medicaid expansion and taking advantage of other 
opportunities provided by the aca to create innovative models of coverage and care for people 
with opioid use disorders. for example, maryland, rhode island, and vermont are using 
variations of the health home model to provide comprehensive care management, care 
coordination, health promotion, comprehensive transitional care/follow-up, individual and family 
support, and referral to community and social support services. these types of care coordination 
models are feasible and affordable for states that have expanded medicaid because most low-
income adults with behavioral health needs now have access to comprehensive health coverage, 
thanks to the acas medicaid expansion. the models, which have now been implemented for 
several years, are significantly improving access to and coordination of care for people with 
opioid use disorders, and other substance use and mental health disorders27.   
 

whats at stake in the aca for the parts of the country most affected by opioid use 
disorder and overdoses  

while the opioid epidemic has affected all parts of the country, some areas have been hit 
especially hard. the states that have been hit the hardest include many of the states that would be 
most affected if the aca coverage gains were rolled back.   
 
according to urban institute estimates28, four states  massachusetts, west virginia, kentucky, 
and new hampshire  would see their uninsured rates nearly or more than triple if the aca 
were repealed. these four states ranked 7th, 1st, 3rd, and 2nd respectively in drug overdose death 
rates in 2015, according to cdc data29. among the remaining seven states with drug overdose 
rates exceeding 22 deaths per 100,000 people, uninsured rates would increase by 155 percent 
(ohio), 170 percent (rhode island), 134 percent (pennsylvania), 136 percent (new mexico), 83 
percent (utah), 79 percent (tennessee), and 124 percent (connecticut).  
 
as the maps (figure 3 and figure 4) below show, this pattern holds more broadly: many of the 
states most affected by drug overdose are also among the states with the most to lose if insurance 
coverage and associated protections under the aca were rolled back. for the reasons discussed 
above, large spikes in uninsured rates could substantially worsen the opioid crisis at a time when 
the emergence of illicitly made fentanyl and other highly potent synthetic opioids linked to large 
clusters of overdoses is rapidly increasing in communities across the u.s.

the opioid epidemic is a public health crisis that will not be reversed overnight. but we are starting to see real progress at all levels of 
government and among communities across our nation, thanks to a shared commitment to stem the tide of the opioid epidemic. 
continued insurance coverage is essential to our ability to be successful, and the crisis is far too urgent to risk undermining our 
progress.
