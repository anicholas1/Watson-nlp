nearly 900,000 puerto ricans may lose health coverage 

when medicaid funds run out  

january 12, 2017 

 
 puerto ricos medicaid program is projected to exhaust the last of the $6.4 billion additional 
funds allocated it for federal fiscal years (fy) 2011-2019 as early as the first quarter of fy 
2018. as many as 900,000 american citizens covered by medicaid in puerto rico could lose 
coverage as a result of the depletion of these funds.  
 
medicaid  the primary source of coverage for low-income families, qualified pregnant women 
and children, and individuals with disabilities  operates differently in u.s. territories than in the 
50 states and the district of columbia (dc). state medicaid programs are provided an unlimited 
amount of available federal matching dollars as long as medicaid agencies can demonstrate that 
the expenses are valid under the program's rules. in contrast, federal funding to medicaid 
programs in the territories is capped. the territories are provided a fixed allotment of funds that 
increase with inflation. as illustrated in figure 1, puerto ricos medicaid funding in fy 2014 
was capped by statute at $321 million.

additionally, the rate at which territories expenditures are matched (known as the federal 
medical assistance percentage or fmap) is set in statute rather than calculated by the per capita 
income formula used for the 50 states (see figure 2). in puerto rico, medicaid expenditures are 
matched at 55 percent compared to state fmaps that range from 50 percent to about 75 percent 
for the poorest state, mississippi. if calculated using the per capita income formula applied to the 
states, puerto ricos fmap would be approximately 93 percent in the absence of a statutory 
upper limit. consequently, it would receive the statutory maximum of 83 percent.

beginning in 2011, puerto ricos medicaid program had access to an additional allotment of 
funding (that is, funds in addition to the pre-existing medicaid statutory cap). totaling $6.4 
billion, these additional funds are available until 2019. puerto rico, however, is on track to 
exhaust the additional aca funding as early as the first quarter of fy 2018 (october-december 
2017). when the funding expires, puerto rico will revert to the original statutory caps of less 
than $400 million shown in figure 1. if the commonwealth continues to contribute the same 
amount to its medicaid program as it is contributing today, total spending would decrease to 44 
percent less than would be required to maintain current enrollment (figure 3), and 500,000 
individuals would lose coverage (figure 4). if, instead, puerto rico spends no commonwealth 
funds above the amount necessary to obtain the maximum federal funding, total spending would 
be 80 percent less than what would be needed to maintain current enrollment, and enrollment 
would drop by nearly 900,000. (see the appendix for a detailed description of how these 
estimates were calculated.)

this drop in enrollment would affect many of puerto ricos most vulnerable citizens. puerto 
rico provides medicaid coverage to individuals with modified adjusted gross incomes of up to 
133 percent of the puerto rico poverty level (prpl), a local poverty level that is lower than the 
federal poverty level (fpl) used by most state medicaid programs. as shown in figure 5, this is 
currently $550 per month (approximately 56 percent of fpl) for a one-person family and $850 
per month (approximately 42 percent of fpl) for a family of four 
(https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/by-state/puerto-rico.html). adults with incomes at or below 
these levels are eligible without regard to parental status.

appendix: background and methods 
 
in september 2016, the most recent month for which data are available from the centers for 
medicare & medicaid services (cms), 1,071,373 individuals, including about 330,000 children, 
were enrolled in puerto ricos medicaid program, the government health insurance plan 
(ghip). this figure does not include 91,116 children enrolled in the childrens health insurance 
program (chip), which covers children with household incomes up to twice the medicaid limits, 
or 166,461 people with commonwealth-only funded coverage for public employees and some 
individuals with incomes above medicaid eligibility limits. it also does not include 261,644 
medicare-medicaid enrollees in platino, a medicare advantage plan. medicaid enrollment in 
recent years has generally been stable. 
 
as is true for the other u.s. territories (american samoa, guam, the commonwealth of the 
northern mariana islands, and the u.s. virgin islands), puerto ricos medicaid funding is 
subject to different provisions than those that apply to the states. fmap is set by statute, rather 
than based on per capita income. before the aca, this rate was set at 50 percent, the same rate 
that is applied to the highest-income states, even though puerto rico is poorer than any state, and 
would qualify for the maximum 83 percent fmap if it were a state. moreover, territorial 
spending is only matched at the statutory fmap up to a statutory cap that is typically reached in 
the first quarter of the fiscal year. 
 
the aca made three changes to these arrangements. first, fmap for the territories was 
permanently increased from 50 percent to 55 percent. second, under section 2005, the territories 
collectively received $6.3 billion for spending above their statutory caps, available between july 
1, 2011 (after similarly purposed monies under the american recovery and reinvestment act 
ended) and september 30, 2019. puerto rico, which accounts for the bulk of the population in 
the five territories, received $5.5 billion under section 2005. third, under section 1323, the 
territories collectively received another $1 billion for medicaid spending above their caps in lieu 
of funding for individuals enrolling in the exchanges that none of them elected to establish. 
puerto rico received $925 million under section 1323, to be spent after exhausting the section 
2005 funds. puerto rico and the other territories must spend section 1323 funds by december 
31, 2019. 
 
the limitation of federal matching funds up to the level set by the statutory cap plus the section 
2005 and 1323 funds, if available, does not apply to children covered under chip. spending on 
medicare-medicaid dual enrollee prescription drug coverage under the enhanced allotment plan 
funding provided to u.s. territories in lieu of a medicare part d low-income subsidy is also 
not counted against the limitation on federal matching funds.  
 
we used the enrollment and expenditure data provided by cms to model two different scenarios 
for the exhaustion of puerto ricos section 2005 and 1323 funds. in scenario 1, puerto rico 
spends the same amount of territorial funds in fy 2018 as in fy 2017, with an adjustment for 
inflation of 3.8 percent based on the change in per enrollee spending from fy 2015 to projected 
fy 2016 spending. in scenario 2, puerto rico spends no unmatched commonwealth funds. both 
scenarios assume that puerto rico responds to reduced funding by reducing coverage (for 
example, by lowering income eligibility limits or by imposing an enrollment cap) rather than by

reducing benefits for those who are covered, which already include only 10 of the 17 categories 
that are mandatory for the states and the district of columbia. 
  
we assumed the september 2016 medicaid enrollment total for both fy 2016 and fy 2017. fy 
2016 federal spending is based on the amount of the statutory cap plus the projected draw on 
section 2005 funds. fy 2017 federal spending is based on the amount of the statutory cap 
(which includes an inflation adjustment) plus the projected exhaustion of section 2005 funds, 
and then an initial draw from section 1323. puerto rico spending is based on federal spending 
multiplied by the commonwealth/federal fmap ratio of .45/.55 = .82. with total enrollment 
held constant, total spending and total spending per enrollee increase by the same assumed 3.8 
percent inflation adjustment between fy 2016 and fy 2017. because the additional funding 
from the aca funding fully covers enrollment at current levels for these years, the estimates for 
fy 2016 and fy 2017 are the same for scenario 1 and scenario 2.  
 
coverage deteriorates in fy 2018 due to the expected exhaustion of section 1323 funding during 
the first quarter, with further deterioration in fy 2019 and fy 2020 when the section 1323 
funding is completely unavailable, so that the only aca provision still in effect is the fmap 
increase. in scenario 1, federal spending is based on the amounts available from the cap plus 
section 1323 (fy 2018 only), and commonwealth spending is assumed to be the same as in fy 
2017, plus the 3.8 percent inflation adjustment in each successive year. we estimated the number 
of enrollees in each year by dividing the available federal and commonwealth funding by total 
spending per enrollee. under these assumptions, total funding for fy 2019 falls to 56 percent of 
what is needed to maintain coverage and benefits and 470,426 individuals lose coverage. the 
estimated number of people losing coverage grows to 471,342 in fy 2020 because the scheduled 
3.0 percent increase in the federal funding cap is below the assumed 3.8 percent annual increase 
in spending per enrollee. 
  
scenario 1 is consistent with commonwealth policy before the recovery act and aca, when 
federal funds covered about 16 percent of annual expenditures, as opposed to the 50 percent that 
would be expected if the commonwealth spent only enough to get the maximum federal match. 
in the context of the current economic crisis and fiscal controls, however, commonwealth 
officials might decide to use scarce resources for competing priorities such as physical 
infrastructure or debt payments rather than for medicaid and spend only up to the amount needed 
to obtain the maximum federal match (scenario 2). coverage outcomes under scenario 2 are 
much worse than in scenario 1 because the exhaustion of federal funding above the statutory 
cap also reduces commonwealth spending. by fy 2019, total spending falls to 20 percent of 
what would be needed to maintain coverage and benefits, and 855,321 individuals lose coverage. 
the estimated number of people losing coverage grows to 856,237 in fy 2020, again because 
the scheduled 3.0 percent increase in the federal funding cap is below the assumed 3.8 percent 
annual increase in spending per enrollee.
