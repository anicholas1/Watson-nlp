an overview of pending asylum  and refugee legislation in the us  congress  melanie nezer1 hias  executive summary there  has  been  no  significant  legislation  related  to  the  asylum  process  enacted in congress in nearly a decade.
in 1996, the illegal immigration  reform and immigration responsibility act (iirira) became law, rolling  back  protections  for  asylum  seekers  by  including  a  one-year  deadline  for  filing  asylum  applications,  subjecting  asylum  seekers  to  expedited  removal procedures, and expanding the detention of asylum seekers.


in  2005, congress enacted the real id act, which created additional legal  barriers  to  asylum,  including  new  requirements  for  proving  an  asylum  claim.
during the past several sessions of congress, bills have been introduced  that  would  make  significant  changes  to  the  countrys  asylum  laws  and  refugee  admissions  program.


this  paper  provides  an  overview  of  the  pending legislation and the changes proposed.
this overview is instructive  in  understanding  (1)  which  members  of  congress  have  demonstrated  interest and leadership in refugee and asylum issues; (2) which refugee and  asylum reform issues have been of most interest to members of congress  in recent years; (3) the different approaches to refugee and asylum issues  by  members  of  congress  who  have  shown  leadership  on  these  issues;  and (4) which provisions have been enacted, which have gained traction,  and  which  remain  pending  without  significant  movement  through  the  legislative process.


while it is difficult to imagine in the current partisan climate how any  asylum or refugee legislation could be enacted into law, some legislative  provisions have been reintroduced over a number of sessions of congress  and some have a history of bipartisan support.
legislation focused on a  group of particular interest or concern to members of congress could gain  traction.


a more comprehensive legislative approach framed by the need  generally to improve the system could be less effective, particularly in the  context of the years-long stalemate on comprehensive immigration reform.

jmhs volume 2 number 2 (2014): 121-143 while legislation is unlikely to pass in the near future, it remains important  for members of congress who believe in the importance a fair, effective, and  humane asylum system and refugee resettlement program, to introduce  and build support for asylum and refugee legislation.
provisions in bills  that have already been introduced, like those in s.


744, are more likely to  be included in legislation that is moving through congress.
in addition,  these bills demonstrate the continued interest of members of congress in  asylum and refugee issues and the need for reform.


they also provide an  important tool for advocates for education and outreach to congress and  the public.
introduction there has been no significant legislation related to the asylum process enacted in congress  in nearly a decade.


in 1996, the illegal immigration reform and immigration responsibility  act  (iirira)  became  law,  rolling  back  protections  for  asylum  seekers  by  including  a  one-year deadline for filing asylum applications, subjecting asylum seekers to expedited  removal procedures,2 and expanding the detention of asylum seekers.
3 in 2005, congress  enacted the real id act, which created additional legal barriers to asylum, including new  requirements for proving an asylum claim.


4   in  recent  years,  legislation  has  been  enacted  to:  increase  admissions  of  iraqi  and  afghan refugees who helped us efforts during the conflicts in those countries;5 give the  administration  more  authority  to  exempt  refugees,  asylees,  and  asylum  seekers  from  the  broad  terrorism-related  grounds  of  inadmissibility;6  and  facilitate  the  processing  of  religious  minorities  from  iran  and  the  former  soviet  union.
7  however,  comprehensive  legislation related to the us refugee resettlement program has not been enacted since the   2  expedited removal refers to the summary deportation by us immigration officials, without a hearing or  review by an immigration judge, of noncitizens who are apprehended at a port of entry or within 100 miles  of the border, have been in the country for less than 14 days and do not possess proper travel documents.


if  the individual expresses a fear of persecution or intention to apply for asylum, the individual must have the  opportunity to demonstrate to an asylum officer that they have a credible fear of persecution.

125  pending asylum and refugee legislation in the us congressimpact refugees, asylum seekers, and stateless persons by expanding the terrorism-related  inadmissibility grounds (trig) of the immigration and nationality act.
the purpose of the  trig provisions is to bar individuals who have engaged in terrorism-related activity from  admission to the us.


27 while intended to address legitimate security concerns, the trig  provisions are extremely broad and have resulted in the exclusion of thousands of bona fide  refugees and asylum seekers from protection (hughes 2009).
the statement also noted that  the safe act would expand the us immigration detention system which already confines  many survivors of torture and others seeking protection in the united states.


the safe act would bar from a finding of good moral character and naturalization  anyone who is described as a terrorist in the immigration and nationality act.
28 this  would permanently bar from naturalization any refugee or asylee who is subject to the  trig bars to admission, possibly including those who obtain exemptions from the trig  bars from the department of homeland security (dhs).


29  the bill would also require  dhs to complete background and security checks before granting any immigration benefit,  including employment authorization.
this could have serious consequences for asylum  applicants whose security and background checks are delayed, as well as for individuals  subject to the trig bars whose cases have been on hold for as many as 10 years while  the administration develops an exemption process.


30   senate-passed legislative provisions  the  following  provisions  were  agreed  to  by  the  bipartisan  senate  gang  of  8,  survived  the bills mark-up, and were included in s.
744 when it passed the senate.


some of these  provisions are also contained in the refugee protection act and other pending bills not  passed by the house or senate.
the one-year filing deadline for asylum applications  since 1996, the law has required that asylum seekers apply for asylum within one year of  arrival in the united states.


31 according to studies, this requirement prevents individuals  with legitimate claims of persecution from gaining asylum protection if their applications  were delayed due to fear, lack of information, or other circumstances beyond their control  (schrag et al.
2010; acer et al.


2010).
in addition, the filing deadline has significantly  lengthened the adjudication of asylum cases and diverts scarce immigration court time and  resources from considering the merits of asylum claims.


32 s.
744 would repeal the one-year filing deadline for asylum applications.


33 the bill also  would allow individuals whose asylum claims were denied because of the one-year filing  deadline to reopen their cases within two years of the date of enactment of the legislation  27  immigration and nationality act,  212(a)(3)(b).

36   the refugee protection act also exempts children from reinstatement of removal, a process  that allows immigration judges to order the removal without any opportunity for relief of  an individual who has illegally reentered the united states after having been previously  ordered removed.


37  refugee and asylee family reunification  s.
744 would eliminate barriers to family reunification by expanding the categories of family  members who qualify for derivative asylee and refugee status to include the children of a  refugee or asylees spouse or children.

for example, if the refugee seeking asylum had a teenage daughter who has a  child, the teenage daughters child could not join her mother and grandmother in the united  states under current law.


the refugee protection act also contains this provision.

127  pending asylum and refugee legislation in the us congressdesignation  of  groups  of  humanitarian  concern  for  refugee   processing s.


744 would allow the president, in consultation with the secretary of state and dhs, to  designate certain groups whose resettlement in the united states is justified by humanitarian  concerns or is otherwise in the national interest as meeting the requirements for refugee  status.
43  a similar provision is included in the refugee protection act.


44 s.
744 would  also extend for a year after enactment the lautenberg amendment, which allows certain  religious minorities from iran and the former soviet union to be admitted as refugees under  expedited procedures, and would authorize the president to extend the provision thereafter.


this provision, if enacted, would help the united states to process more efficiently some  groups of refugees for resettlement.
allowing the administration to determine that certain  categories of refugees have been persecuted before a resettlement program begins would  permit dhs interviewers to focus on admissibility and security issues during the refugee  interview, rather than on re-establishing whether each individual member of a group meets  the refugee definition.


granting authority to asylum officers to conduct asylum hearings   and grant asylum after a finding of credible fear  since 1996, asylum officers have been required to refer asylum seekers identified at or near  a us border who demonstrate a credible fear of persecution to immigration courts, rather  than  adjudicating  the  cases  themselves  (as  they  do  in  affirmative  asylum  cases).
45 this  significantly lengthens the asylum process, wastes scarce government resources, exposes  asylum-seekers to additional trauma, and, in some cases, prolonged detention.


s.
744 would allow an asylum officer to grant asylum to an applicant who demonstrates  a credible fear of persecution at or near a us border, after conducting a non-adversarial  asylum  interview  and  seeking  supervisory  review.


46  the  refugee  protection  act  also  includes this provision.
47  legal status for stateless individuals  stateless individuals are those who lost their nationality when their country of origin  ceased  to  exist,  were  arbitrarily  stripped  of  their  nationality,  or  have  been  without  a  nationality since birth because of unclear nationality laws or laws that discriminate based  on gender or ethnicity.


many stateless individuals in the united states have no legal status.
because  they  have  no  citizenship  anywhere,  stateless  persons  with  removal  orders  can  remain in detention for prolonged periods of time and have no legal status when released.


without a path to permanent legal status in the united states, many stateless individuals  43  border security, economic opportunity, and immigration modernization act, s.

s.
744 would provide new protections for stateless persons in the united states, including  authorizing the secretary of homeland security or the attorney general to grant conditional  lawful status (leading to lawful permanent residence after one year) to certain groups of  designated stateless persons.


48  the refugee protection act also contains these provisions.
49  improved overseas refugee processing  refugee applicants who are denied resettlement by dhs have no meaningful opportunity  to challenge the negative decision, in large part because refugees are not given enough  information to reveal the basis for the rejection.


denied refugee applicants are sent only a  form letter with a list of checkboxes citing the general reasons that the applicant was denied  (one of which is other).
as a result, it is extremely difficult for a refugee to prepare a  request for review (rfr) of the denial (there is no appeal process for refugee denials) or  clear up any misunderstandings or miscommunications that may have occurred during the  refugee interview.


s.
744 would allow an attorney or accredited representative, at no expense to the government,  to represent an applicant for refugee status at the refugee interview.


the bill would also  require that denials of refugee applications be issued in writing with a detailed explanation  of the reason for the denial.
50  at the end of 2013, congress enacted the national defense  authorization act of 2014, which included these provisions, but limited them to certain  refugee applicants, and iraqi and afghan special immigrant visa applicants.


51  security checks  before entering the us, refugee resettlement applicants must pass a series of security and  health screenings.
while efficient and effective security screenings are a critical element  of the refugee resettlement program, the security clearance process can take years, during  which time a refugee may remain at risk of persecution.


because the numerous required  checks, interviews, and screenings are only valid for certain defined time periods, by the  time later checks are concluded, the first checks have expired and must be redone.
the  refugee resettlement process has become for many a loop of clearances that will never be  completed.

53  the provision codifies  existing security checks.


the  strengthening  refugee  resettlement act  would  direct  the  secretary  of  homeland  security to work with the heads of other relevant federal agencies to conduct a review of  refugee processing with the goal of streamlining processing, consistent with maintaining  security.
54  termination of refugee status for return to home country  s.


744 includes a provision offered by senator graham (r-sc)55 and adopted during the  mark-up that would terminate the refugee or asylee status of an individual who without  good cause returns to his or her country of nationality (or country of last residence, for those  who are stateless).
56 the provision does not apply to cubans eligible for legal permanent  residence under the cuban adjustment act of 1966.


there are already provisions in current  law that permit dhs to revoke refugee and asylum status from individuals who return.
57  employment authorization for asylum seekers  since 1996, asylum seekers have been subject to a 180-day waiting period to apply for  work authorization.


58 dhs and the department of justice have determined that the clock  that counts this 180-day period stops if there is any delay in the adjudication process that  is requested or caused by the asylum seeker.
59 there have been numerous problems with  the implementation of this provision, known as the asylum clock, including a lack of  transparency in the management of the clock; a lack of clarity and comprehensiveness of  the governments clock policy; misinterpretation of the regulations governing the clock;  improper implementation of the governments clock policy; and problems associated with  the  executive  office  for  immigration  reviews  case  completion  goals  (saucedo  and  rodriguez 2010).


when an immigration judge erroneously stops the clock, asylum seekers  must wait longer than 180 days before they are eligible to obtain work authorization, and  some may have to wait indefinitely.
during the s.


744 mark-up, the judiciary committee adopted a provision offered by senator  coons (d-de) that requires that an asylee be granted employment authorization 180 days  after filing his or her asylum application.

representative sensenbrenner (r-wi) introduced  similar  legislation  in  the  house.
64  this  legislation  has  been  introduced  during  the  past  several sessions of congress.


65   the measure is largely a show of congressional support for  tibetan refugees in nepal and elsewhere who have not been resettled in large numbers for  reasons involving chinas resistance to having displaced tibetans recognized as refugees.
legislative  provisions  included  in  pending  legislation,  not passed by the house or senate  the terrorism related inadmissibility grounds (trig)  in  2001,  congress  enacted  the  usa  patriot act,  which  expanded  the  terrorism-related  grounds of inadmissibility (trig bars to admission).


the goal of the legislation was to  prevent individuals who have engaged in acts of terrorism from being granted admission  to the united states.
however, due to the extremely broad definition of terrorist activity  in  the  law  and  the  expansive  legal  interpretations  adopted  by  the  bush  and  obama  administrations, victims of oppression seeking refugee protection have been mislabeled  as supporters of terrorist organizations or participants in terrorist activity.

131  pending asylum and refugee legislation in the us congressrefugee or asylum protection or other status delayed or denied (hughes 2009).
early efforts to address the problems created by the trig bars were bipartisan.


in 2006,  representative pitts (r-pa) and 21 cosponsors evenly split between the parties introduced  a bill to amend the immigration and nationality act to protect vulnerable refugees and  asylum seekers.
66  however, when a bipartisan amendment to remedy some aspects of the  trig problem was offered to the senate comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2006,  it was tabled by a large bipartisan vote.


67  in 2007, congress enacted a provision sponsored by senator kyl (r-az) and senator leahy  (d-vt) to expand executive authority to issue exemptions for individuals unjustly excluded  from immigration benefits because of the broad trig bars.
68 however, bipartisanship on  this issue seems to have significantly diminished after this provision was enacted, as there  has been no bipartisan legislative action since.


from  2007  to  2014,  the  administration  used  the  discretionary  authority  granted  by  congress in 2007 to exempt certain individuals and groups from the trig bars.
69 these  exemption announcements were printed in the federal register or in policy guidance from  dhs.


typically, a few members of congress would issue statements in support, and no  one would issue objections.
however, house judiciary committee chair robert goodlatte  (r-va) publicly criticized an obama administration announcement in march 201470 that  authorized new exemptions for individuals who provided insignificant or incidental  support to non-designated terrorist groups (preston 2014).


the refugee protection act would revise the definition of terrorist activity for purposes  of  inadmissibility,  define  material  support  as  support  that  is  significant  and  directly  relevant to terrorist activity, and expressly exclude activity committed under duress from  the terrorism definition.
71  the refugee protection act is the only pending legislation that  would directly amend the trig provisions in existing law.


the safe act would bar from a finding of good moral character and naturalization anyone  who  is  subject  to  the  trig  bars,  possibly  including  refugees  and  asylees  who  obtain  exemptions from the bars from dhs.

132  journal on migration and human security particular social group and real id act requirements  to qualify for asylum, an applicant must show he or she was persecuted or fears persecution  on account of one of the five grounds enumerated in the immigration and nationality  act.
73 it can be difficult for some asylum applicants asserting persecution based on their  membership in a particular social group to show that the harm they suffered was on  account  of  their  membership  in  that  group.


refugees  fleeing  gender-based  violence  in  particular  can  face  difficulty  proving  persecution  because  their  persecutors  may  not  articulate the reasons for inflicting harm, and evidence can be difficult to obtain (acer and  magner 2013).
the refugee protection act would define any group whose members share a characteristic  that is either immutable or fundamental to identity, conscience, or the exercise of the persons  human rights such that the person should not be required to change it as a particular social  group.


74 it would also amend the real id act by no longer requiring asylum applicants  to show one central reason for their persecution and amending its provisions relating to  credibility and corroboration.
75  these provisions, enacted in 2005, increased the burden  of proof for asylum applicants, making it more difficult for them to demonstrate that they  were persecuted or have a well-founded fear of persecution.


changes to detention and removal  the refugee protection act proposes significant changes to detention procedures for asylum  seekers.
these  include:  making  detention  discretionary  for  arriving  asylum  seekers;76  requiring  the  secretary  of  homeland  security  to  establish  an  alternatives  to  detention  program to increase the use of supervised forms of release and reduce the detention of  asylum seekers;77 improving the conditions of detention;78 and requiring dhs to provide  notice  of  immigration  charges  to  the  immigrant  and  the  immigration  court  closest  to  the place of apprehension within 48 hours  of detention.


79 the bill would also establish  procedures to ensure the accuracy of statements taken by dhs in the course of expedited  removal proceedings.
80  the refugee protection act would authorize (but not require) the attorney general to appoint  counsel to represent an individual in removal proceedings.


81  the bill would also establish a  brief stay of removal for immigrants ordered removed.
it would prohibit an individual from  being removed during the 30-day window for filing for review of a removal order with an  appellate court.

133  pending asylum and refugee legislation in the us congressinterdiction at sea  the us intercepts and returns haitians who flee by boat without offering them meaningful  access  to  an  asylum  interview.


under  current  policy,  haitians  are  given  access  to  an  asylum screening only if they physically or verbally resist return by the us coast guard,  a procedure known as the shout test.
the shout test is ineffective as a screening tool  and does not meet international legal standards.


the us uses more thorough screening  mechanisms for cuban migrants at sea that include informing them of the ability to raise  persecution concerns with a us officer (unhcr 2013).
the refugee protection act would require an asylum interview for any migrant intercepted  at sea who has expressed a fear of return.


it would also require dhs to establish a uniform  asylum screening procedure that provides the interdicted individual a meaningful opportunity  to express a fear of return through a translator and provides that person information about  their ability to inform us officers about a fear of return.
the refugee protection act would  also require that asylees be given the opportunity to seek protection in a country where he  or she has family or other ties or, absent such ties, to be resettled in the united states.


83   admitting refugees in legal permanent resident status  current law requires refugees to wait one year after arriving in the united states before  they can apply to adjust their status to become a lawful permanent resident (lpr), but also  mandates that refugees adjust their status within one year of arrival.
advocates have argued  that admitting refugees as lprs would fix this legal impossibility.


admitting refugees as  lprs would increase efficiency and significantly reduce costs by eliminating the additional  step of adjudicating petitions for adjustment of status from refugees.
whereas adjustment  of status is a process that is paid for by applicants for other immigration benefits, refugee  adjustment applications require no fee.


the  strengthening  refugee  resettlement act  would  permit  refugees  and  their  spouses  and children to be admitted to the united states as lawful permanent residents, and allow  asylum  seekers  to  apply  for  lawful  permanent  resident  status  immediately  after  being  granted asylum status.
it also would allow the spouse and children of asylum seekers to be  admitted to the united states with lawful permanent resident status.


84  while  this  provision  was  not  included  in  s.
744  or  the  2013  version  of  the  refugee  protection act, the version of the refugee protection act that was introduced in the 111th  congress did contain the provision.


85 although the 2013 version of the refugee protection act would not allow refugees to arrive  in the united states with lpr status, the bill repeals a statutory provision that requires a  refugee to return or be returned to the custody of the department of homeland security  one year after admission to be considered for adjustment of status.
86 the refugee protection  act replaces this requirement with a provision that makes refugees eligible for adjustment   83  the refugee protection act of 2013, s.

87  indonesian asylum seekers   the indonesian family refugee protection act authorizes a qualifying indonesian citizen  whose asylum claim was denied solely upon a failure to meet the one-year filing deadline  to file a motion to reopen such claim.


88 the bill is an effort to assist a group of indonesian  christians who came to the united states in the late 1990s on tourist visas but did not file  their asylum claims before the one-year filing deadline.
liberians  in  temporary  protected  status/  deferred  enforced   departure several  thousand  liberian  refugees  have  been  in  temporary  protected  status  (tps)  or  deferred enforced departure (ded) status since 1991.


tps and ded are administrative  remedies that allow noncitizens to legally remain in the united states for a period of time  if their country has been affected by war, natural disaster, or other emergency making it  unsafe  for  them  to  return.
the  group  fled  liberia  during  the  countrys  late  1980s  civil  war, during which at least 150,000 people died and more than half the population fled the  country or became internally displaced.


senator reed (d-ri) has led efforts for many years to provide permanent legal status to  this group of liberians.
the liberian refugee immigration fairness act of 2013 would  allow liberians present in the united states since january 2013, as well as their spouses  and unmarried children, to apply for permanent resident status.


89    refugee resettlement  the  president,  in  consultation  with  congress,  decides  how  many  refugees  the  united  states will resettle each year.
for fiscal year 2014, president obama recommended that the  united states resettle 76,000 refugees.


historically, refugee admissions have been as high  as 207,000 in 1980 and as low as 27,000 in 2002 (when admissions plummeted after the  september 11 attacks).
the typical range for refugee admissions has been between 60,000  to 90,000 per year.

prm  coordinates the us refugee program and is responsible for recommending to the president  the overall number of refugees to be admitted each year, subject to available funding and  the needs of refugees worldwide.
orr is responsible for services to refugees after the  initial resettlement period.


uscis is responsible for screening all refugees to determine if  they qualify for admission to the united states and do not present a security risk.
91  s.


744  does  not  contain  provisions  relating  to  the  us  refugee  admissions  program.
however, several bills pending in congress address longstanding problems of the program,  which congress has not amended in any significant way since the refugee act of 1980 was  enacted nearly 35 years ago.


funding:  prm manages the reception and placement or r&p program for arriving  refugees through funding agreements with the nine nonprofit agencies.
the r&p program  is intended to welcome arriving refugees, provide the essential services they need during  their first 90 days in the united states (including housing, clothing, food, and referrals to  medical and social services), and provide a link to longer-term services funded by orr.


in  january 2010, prm announced the doubling of the r&p grant, from $900 to $1,800 dollars  per refugee.
this amount was increased to $1,875 dollars for fy 2013.


at least $1,125  dollars is allocated directly to the refugee to pay for housing, household goods, food, and  other immediate material needs for the first month, and up to $750 dollars is used by the  affiliate agency to pay staff and other agency expenses incurred in providing services to  the refugees.
92 prior to 2010, the per capita level had not kept pace with inflation or cost  of living.


the refugee protection act and the strengthening refugee resettlement act  would require the per capita amount to be adjusted each year for inflation and the cost of  living, and make other changes that would help agencies to maintain capacity if a lower  than anticipated number of refugees is admitted in a fiscal year.
93  orr provides funding to help refugees during the eight months following their arrival in  the united states.


the current orr funding formula was devised in 1980, when unlike  today  there  was  no  way  to  project  future  arrivals  accurately  and  projections  for  future  arrivals  could  only  be  made  based  on  past  years  admissions  numbers.
the  domestic  refugee resettlement reform and modernization act states that orr funding formulas  are retroactive in nature, using refugee admission data from up to three prior years, so  that large increases in refugee admissions are not adequately reflected in the amount of  resources  provided  by  orr.


the  refugee  protection act,  the  strengthening  refugee  resettlement act, and the domestic refugee resettlement reform and modernization act  would all adjust the formula for providing refugee funding to states and allow orr to  consider both past and projected refugee arrivals to determine funding levels to reimburse  states for services provided to refugees.
this provision was also included in prior versions  of the strengthening refugee resettlement act and the domestic refugee resettlement  reform and modernization act.

95 this type of fund  has been under serious discussion by the administration in recent months as the number  of unaccompanied alien children (uacs)unauthorized immigrant children who arrive  in the united states without their parents and are transferred to the custody of orr after  apprehension by dhshas climbed and funding for orr services, even with an increased  appropriation, is likely to fall short.
the presidents fiscal year 2015 budget includes a  proposal for the creation of a contingency fund for providing resources to serve uacs in  the future.


96   studies,  reports,  and  data:    at  its  inception,  the  us  refugee  resettlement  program  provided up to three years of support to refugees to promote integration.
since the mid- 1990s, however, eligibility periods for support have been reduced and early self-sufficiency  has become the chief priority of the program.


the state department notes that the us  refugee resettlement program has found that people learn english and begin to function  comfortably much faster if they start work soon after arrival,97 and the refugee act of  1980  includes  an  emphasis  on  early  employment.
a  2013  government accountability  office (gao) report on refugee resettlement stated that the federal government evaluates  refugee resettlement programs based on early employment and self-suf ficiency and not  long-term integration (gao 2012).


the  refugee  protection  act  and  the  domestic  refugee  resettlement  reform  and  modernization  act  direct  the  gao  to  conduct  a  study  of  orrs  domestic  refugee  resettlement program, including how the orr defines self-sufficiency, the effectiveness  of the resettlement program in helping refugees achieve self-sufficiency, and the amount  of resources needed to address the unmet needs of refugees.

137  pending asylum and refugee legislation in the us congressfor  refugee  and  asylee  resettlement  (hhs)  to  report  to  congress  regarding  states  experiencing secondary migration, its impact, the availability of social services in those  states, and the needs of the secondary migrants.
the two bills would also require hhs to  provide assistance to refugees who are secondary migrants.


100  coordination of the us refugee resettlement program:  the us refugee resettlement  program involves the work of many agencies, including dhs, hhs, the state department,  as well as various security agencies, but no one agency is responsible for coordinating all  aspects of the program to ensure joint planning, information sharing, and problem solving.
the  strengthening  refugee  resettlement act  expresses  the  sense  of  the  congress  that  the president should appoint a white house coordinator on refugee protection.


101 the  domestic refugee resettlement reform and modernization act aims to address some of  the coordination problems by elevating the orr director position to assistant secretary  of health and human services for refugee and asylee resettlement, appointed by the  president and reporting directly to the secretary.
102 strengthening refugee assistance programs:  under current law, refugees are eligible  for up to three years of cash and medical assistance, job placement, and social services.


however, orr provides cash and medical services for only eight months.
the strengthening  refugee resettlement act would require orr to provide services for one year, subject  to the availability of funds, and to provide services to the elderly, sick, and those with  extraordinary challenges to integration for three years.


103 the bill would increase cash  assistance to refugees104 and provide grants to nonprofit agencies to help refugees become  integrated in their communities by providing naturalization services, employment training  and  professional  recertification.
105  the  strengthening  refugee  resettlement  act  would  also expand eligibility for the refugee matching grant program, a federal-private refugee  assistance program.


106   refugee eligibility for social security income (ssi) benefits:  social security income  (ssi) provides elderly, blind, and disabled persons a monthly stipend.
prior to 1996, ssi was  available to refugees without any time limitation as long as they remained impoverished  and  disabled  or  elderly.


however,  the  personal  responsibility  and  work  opportunity  reconciliation act of 1996 mandated that refugees naturalize within seven years of arriving  in the united states to maintain eligibility for ssi.
107  some elderly refugees, particularly  those  who  do  not  have  high  levels  of  literacy  in  their  native  language,  face  difficultly  learning english in order to qualify for citizenship.


the  refugee  protection act  would  extend  the  eligibility  for  ssi  assistance  to  asylees,  100  the refugee protection act of 2013, s.

the bill would also exempt additional  applicants over the age of 55 from the english language requirements by lowering the time  in lpr status required to obtain an exemption.


110 english language and work orientation for approved refugees:  the strengthening  refugee resettlement act directs the secretary of state to establish english language and  work orientation programs for refugees approved for resettlement prior to their departure  for the united states.
this would expand an existing state department pilot program that  provides english-as-a-second language classes for some refugees in kenya, thailand, and  nepal.


as noted by the state department, by introducing the study of english overseas,  these classes are intended to provide basic english competency and promote continued  language learning after arrival in the united states.
111  conclusion advocates  for  refugees  in  congress  historically  have  worked  together  on  a  bipartisan  basis.


112  in 2003, ileana ros-lehtinen (r-fl), christopher smith (r-nj), john conyers,  jr.
(d-mi) and zoe lofgren (d-ca) formed the bipartisan congressional refugee caucus  (usccb 2003).


the purpose of the caucus was to lift up those refugee issues requiring  congressional attention including iraqi and afghan refugees, re-figuring the resettlement  numbers for the united states, the effects on refugees of the worsening economy, protection  of darfur refugees, and the need for increased protection of refugees, especially women and  girls (disciples home missions 2009).
the bipartisan caucus also served to give greater  visibility to refugees, internally displaced persons, and asylum seekers around the world  and to mobilize support within the house of representatives for refugee resettlement and  overseas protection and assistance (ibid.


).
in a march 2003 dear colleague letter to their  fellow representatives, the co-chairs stated that the caucus will be dedicated to affirming  the united states leadership and commitment to the protection, humanitarian needs, and  compassionate treatment of refugees and persons in refugee-like situations throughout the  world (usccb 2003).


the bipartisan congressional refugee caucus was formally renewed through the 111th  108  the refugee protection act of 2013, s.

139  pending asylum and refugee legislation in the us congresscongress,  which  ended  in  2010,  but  was  not  renewed  after  that  (thats  my  congress!
2011).


during the 113th congress, the approach to asylum and refugee issues in the house  of representatives has been partisan.
the bills offered by house democrats (the refugee  protection act, the strengthening refugee resettlement act, and the domestic refugee  resettlement reform and modernization act) and the bill offered by house republicans  (the safe act) have no provisions in common and only the domestic refugee resettlement  reform and modernization act has bipartisan support.


while it is difficult to imagine in this partisan climate how any of these provisions could be  enacted into law, some of the provisions have been reintroduced over a number of sessions  of congress and have a history of bipartisan support.
legislation focused on a group of  particular interest or concern to members of congress could gain some traction.


the iraqi  and afghan special immigrant visa legislation, the lautenberg amendment for iranian  and former soviet union religious minorities, and the kyl-leahy trig provision, were  of interest to members of congress because they resolved problems faced by particularly  compelling  groups  in  need  of  protection.
legislation  framed  by  how  it  could  help  a  particular population could be an effective approach and a good tool for education and  outreach efforts in congress.


a more comprehensive legislative approach framed by the  need generally to improve the system could be less effective, particularly in the context of  the years-long stalemate on comprehensive immigration reform.
while legislation is unlikely in the near future, it remains important for members of congress  who  believe  in  a  fair,  effective,  and  humane  asylum  system  and  refugee  resettlement  program, to introduce and build support for asylum and refugee legislation.


provisions in  bills that have already been introduced, like those in s.
744, are more likely to be included  in legislation that is moving through congress.


in addition, these bills demonstrate the  continued interest of members of congress in these issues and the need for reform, and  they provide an important tool for advocates for education and outreach to congress and  the public.
