enemy territory: immigration  enforcement in the us-mexico  borderlands  walter a.
ewing american immigration council  executive summary for the last two decades, the guiding strategy of immigration enforcement  along the us-mexico border has been prevention through deterrence, or  stopping unauthorized immigrants from entering the country rather than  apprehending  those  who  have  already  crossed  the  border.


prevention  through deterrence has entailed a massive concentration of enforcement  personnel and resources along the border and at ports of entry.
it has also  led to the detention and removal of increasing numbers of unauthorized  immigrants and far greater use of expedited removal.


as  gauged  by  the  doubling  in  size  of  the  unauthorized  immigrant  population over the same period, prevention through deterrence has not  been a successful enforcement strategy.
moreover, it has funneled more  migrants  to  their  death  in  the  deserts  and  mountains  of  the  southwest  as they (and smugglers) resort to increasingly dangerous routes to evade  border enforcement.


in addition, there has been public concern over ethnic  profiling and the use of extraordinary authority by border patrol agents to  conduct arbitrary searches within 100 miles of the border.
despite these  problems,  the  federal  government  continues  to  spend  billions  of  dollars  each year on the prevention through deterrence strategy.


a  first  step  in  overcoming  the  deficiencies  of  this  border  enforcement  strategy is to strengthen accountability within the border patrol, so that  allegations of excessive force and abuse are investigated and adjudicated  promptly  and  appropriately.
the  culture  of  the  border  patrol  must  be  transformed to foster respect for rights.


more broadly, the mission of the  border patrol should be to capture dangerous individuals and to disrupt  the  operations  of  the  transnational  criminal  organizations  that  traffic  people, drugs, guns, and money.
in addition, providing more pathways to  legal entry through immigration reform would enhance border security by  attenuating the flow of unauthorized immigrants within which dangerous  criminals or terrorists can hide.


finally, the us government should pursue  economic policies to promote development in mexico and central american  countries in order to address the underlying causes of migration.

jmhs volume 2 number 3 (2014): 198-222tenuous rights in  2008,  the  american  civil  liberties  union  (aclu)  described  the  us  border  as  a  constitution-free zone, referring to a 100-mile wide strip of territory around the external  boundary  of  the  nation  within  which  fourth amendment  protections  against  random  and arbitrary stops and searches by law-enforcement officials do not apply.


according to  the aclu, the 197.
4 million people residing in this zoneroughly two-thirds of the us  populationare subject to administrative stops by the border patrol or other federal  authorities for the purpose of guarding the nations borders from security threats (aclu  2008b).


the inland checkpoints where the border patrol conducts administrative stops  and searches are mostly clustered near the southwest borderlands of california, arizona,  and texas, but are also found along the northern border in washington state and could, in  principle, appear anywhere else along us land or coastal borders (aclu 2008a).
while the aclus depiction of a border zone devoid of constitutional guarantees may be  over-stated, it does powerfully convey the manner in which federal authorities often treat  the borderlands, and especially the us-mexico borderlands, as enemy territory (nevins  2010,  171-73).


the  extraordinary  authority  of  border  patrol  agents  to  conduct  inland  border searches under the rationale of border protection has too often resulted in human  rights violations inflicted upon both immigrants and native-born americans.
some border  communitieslike douglas, arizonaare so permeated by border patrol personnel and  equipment that the lives of all residents are disrupted to varying degrees (nevins 2010,  155-58).


over  the  course  of  decades,  federal  lawmakers  have  not  only  poured  more  and  more  resources into controlling immigration and securing the border, but have fundamentally  changed the nations border and immigration enforcement strategies to prevent unauthorized  immigrants from entering the country.
yet legal immigration channels remain woefully  inadequate to accommodate the demand for either temporary or permanent visas.


with a  lack of legal immigration options, migrants, many of whom have close family in the united  states, risk death by seeking to cross the us-mexico border without authorization.
once  in the united states, they live in a precarious state defined by their unlawful presence.


the evolution of us border enforcement since the creation of the border patrol in 1924, many border communities have been living  with heavy-handed border enforcement.
but the nature and scale of that enforcement has  varied considerably over time, with different communities experiencing different degrees  of  border  patrol  intrusion  at  different  periods.


during  the  1960s,  1970s,  and  1980s,  the immigration enforcement strategy of the border patrol was focused on the arrest of  unauthorized  immigrants  who  had  already  made  it  across  the  border  and  entered  the  united states (dunn 2009, 125-63; rosenblum 2013, 3).
as a result, the border patrol  was highly active in mexican-american communities in border cities like el paso, texas,  which meant that us citizens of mexican heritage were often stopped, searched for drugs  and  weapons,  and  questioned  about  their  immigration  status.


moreover,  unauthorized  immigrants and native-born citizens alike fell victim to beatings and other forms of abuse  at the hands of border patrol agents (dunn 2009, 125-63).
199  immigration enforcement in the us-mexico borderlands life  along  the  border  began  to  change  substantially  in  the  early  1990s  with  the  implementation of a prevention through deterrence strategy of immigration enforcement  devoted  to  deterring  unauthorized  entry  into  the  country.


this  was  to  be  accomplished  by amassing enforcement personnel and resources directly along the border (dunn 2009,  125-63; rosenblum 2013, 3).
as this strategy was gradually implemented along more of  the  border,  traditional  crossing  points  in  urban  areas  became  more  difficult  to  traverse  and unauthorized flows shifted to outlying areas.


as a result, the growing ranks of border  patrol  agents  began  to  deploy  to  more  rural  communities  comprised  mainly  of  immigrants.
enforcement efforts therefore became more tightly focused on noncitizens,  and the abuses which occurred were now less visible to the general public (dunn 2009,  125-63, 196).


but the abuses were no less real, and us citizens in urban areas were not  immune to the periodic enforcement excesses of roving patrols (rosas 2012).
however,  the  efforts  of  advocacy  groups  such  as  the  border  network  for  human  rights  have  succeeded in curbing abuses in some locales (peter 2014).


the quest for prevention through deterrence the strategy of prevention through deterrence was first implemented in el paso in 1993  as operation blockade, then in san diego in 1994 as operation gatekeeper, and later in  other portions of the texas, california, and arizona borderlands (dunn 2009, 1; rosenblum  2013, 3-4; massey, et al.
2002, 93-95).


these various operations were characterized by the  massing of border patrol agents at the border together with an assortment of technologies  which came to include ground radar, cameras, motion detectors, thermal imaging sensors,  stadium  lighting,  helicopters,  and  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  (rosenblum  2013,  17-18).
but  the  symbolic  centerpiece  of  prevention  through  deterrence  has  always  been  the  border fence.


starting with just a single 14-mile stretch in san diego that was completed  in 1993, by february 10, 2012, us customs and border protection (cbp)the parent  agency of the border patrol within the us department of homeland security (dhs)had  finished building 651 miles of pedestrian and vehicle fencing along the us-mexico border  (nuez-neto and kim 2008, 1; cbp 2014a).
the fence is symbolic not only because of  its imposing presence, but also because it does not work as a deterrent.


according to the  us government accountability office (gao), during fiscal year (fy) 2010 there were  4,037 documented and repaired breaches of border fencing (gao 2011, 9).
and no one  knows how many times smugglers have simply driven over the fence by using a system of  truck-mounted hydraulic ramps (goddard 2012, 5).


effective or not, a massive amount of money and manpower has been poured into border  enforcement since the initiation of prevention through deterrence.
the annual budget  of the border patrol has increased ten-fold, from $363 million in fy 1993 to $3.


5 billion  in fy 2013 (us border patrol 2014a).
during this same period, the number of border  patrol agents stationed along the southwest border increased from 3,444 to 18,611 (us  border  patrol  2014b).


these  increases  eventually  had  a  major  impact  on  every  border  patrol sector (us border patrol 2014b).

however,  the  fundamental  goal  of  deterring  unauthorized  immigration  through concentrated border enforcement has remained the same (rosenblum 2013, 3).
the first reshaping of the strategy came in the wake of 9/11 with the dissolution of the  ins and the creation of dhs.


the new national border patrol strategy of 2004 placed  a high rhetorical value on the interdiction of terrorists attempting to cross the border and  emphasized  the  use  of  smart  border  technology  (camera  systems,  sensor  platforms,  gamma x-rays) to get the job done.
yet the primary day-to-day work of the agency would  continue to be the deterrence of illegal entries through improved enforcement (cbp 2004,  2-3).


the next iteration of this approach came with the 20052010 strategic plan of cbp.
the plans title, protect america, encapsulated the continued rhetorical focus on fighting  terrorism.


in addition, the plan called for establishing and maintaining operational control  of the borders through a combination of personnel, technology, and a more centralized  command structure within the border patrol (cbp 2005, 2, 23).
dhs secure border initiative  the central role of technology in securing the border was apparent in dhss secure border  initiative  (sbi)  of  2005.


the  rather  ambitious  aim  of  sbi  was  to  achieve  operational  control of both the northern and southern border within five yearswhich did not occur.
nevertheless, this goal was to have been achieved through a variety of means, including a  general ramping up of immigration enforcement both along the borders and in the interior  of the country; ending the so-called catch and release of unauthorized immigrants from  countries other than mexico; and expanding immigration-detention capacity and use of the  expedited removal process.


however, the centerpiece of sbi was increased investment  in tactical infrastructure along the border (fences and vehicle barriers), together with  the development of sbinet, a system of smart technologies such as thermal imaging,  ground radar, and drones that would allow border patrol agents to detect the unauthorized  entry of immigrants into the united states (dhs 2005; rosenblum 2013, 5-6).
sbinet  sbinet did not go smoothly.


in september 2006, cbp awarded a contract to boeing to  develop and deploy sbinet technologies.
one of boeings first tasks was project 28, a  $20.


6 million effort to secure 28 miles of border in sasabe, arizona (ewing 2010; miller  2014).
boeing was not up to the task.


according to a 2010 gao report, the number of new  sbinet defects has increased faster than the number of defects that have been fixed, which  is not a trend that is indicative of a maturing system (gao 2010, 25).
on march 16, 2010,  homeland security secretary janet napolitano froze funding for the program and issued  a statement noting that the system of sensors and cameras along the southwest border  known as sbinet has been plagued with cost overruns and missed deadlines.


a decision  was made to redeploy funds to off-the-shelf, tested, commercially available security   203  immigration enforcement in the us-mexico borderlands technology  (dhs  2010).
after  sbinet  was  officially  cancelled  in  january  2011,  cbp  developed the arizona border surveillance technology plana combination of cameras,  radars, and sensors designed to secure the arizona-mexico border (gao 2014, 2).


ending catch and release  sbi also involved changes in the way unauthorized immigrants were handled and processed  by the border patrol.
until recently, if the immigrant was from mexico and did not have  any outstanding warrants, was not a convicted felon, and had not been formally removed  or  deported  from  the  united  states,  he  or  she  could  be  voluntarily  returned  home.


but if an immigrant with a clean record was what the border patrol terms other than  mexican (otm), he or she was placed in removal proceedings.
the border patrol would  then contact the office of enforcement and removal operations at us immigration and  customs enforcement (ice)the interior-enforcement counterpart to cbp within dhs to  determine  if  detention  space  was  available  for  the  immigrant  to  be  held  during  the  removal process.


if there was no available space, as was often the case, then the immigrant  would be issued a notice to appear before an immigration judge on a specified date and  released on his or her own recognizance.
most immigrants who were issued a notice to  appear did not do so.


as a result, critics dubbed the practice catch and release and it  was largely ended in august 2006 (nuez-neto et al.
2006, 2-10).


1   expansion of expedited removal authority  putting an end to the policy of catch and release involved not only an increase in the  detention capacity of ice, but also an expansion of the expedited removal process by  which arriving immigrants are removed from the united states without the opportunity for a  hearing before an immigration judge.
immigrants who enter without proper documentation  can be summarily removed from the united states by an immigration officer unless they  request asylum or express a fear of persecution or torture if returned home, in which case  they are supposed to be referred to an asylum officer who determines if that fear is credible.


in addition to being accorded scant legal rights, immigrants placed into expedited removal,  as well as those awaiting a credible fear determination, are subject to mandatory detention.
expedited removal was originally applied only to immigrants arriving at ports of entry.


but  it was expanded in 2005 to include immigrants apprehended by the border patrol between  ports of entry along the southwest border, and, in 2006, to immigrants apprehended along  the northern border.
the federal government currently applies expedited removal authority  to unauthorized immigrants arrested up to 100 miles from a land border, and who arrived  in the united states within the previous 14 days (siskin and wasem 2008, 4-8).


cbp consequence delivery system  at  the  same  time  sbi  was  being  implemented,  cbp  was  rolling  out  its  consequence   1  unauthorized immigrants who request asylum and are found to have a credible fear of persecution if  returned to their home countries can be paroled into the united statesa practice which is also referred to  by critics as catch and release (nuez-neto et al.
2006, 4).


204  journal on migration and human securitydelivery system (rosenblum 2013, 6-8).
as described by border patrol chief michael  j.


fisher,  consequence  delivery  uses  a  combination  of  criminal  and  administrative  consequences  developed  by  the  border  patrol,  and  implemented  with  the  assistance  of  ice,  targeting  specific  classifications  of  offenders,  effectively  breaking  the  smuggling  cycle along the border of the united states (fisher 2011a).
in practice, this means that  fewer apprehended mexicans are given the option of voluntary return to mexico.


rather,  the  border  patrol  now  opts  for  three  types  of  high  consequence  outcomes:  formal  removal (deportation); immigration-related criminal charges; and lateral repatriation (that  is, sending immigrants to remote locations far from the smugglers who took them across  the  border)  (rosenblum  2013,  6-8).
lateral  repatriation  can  result  in  the  separation  of  family  members  who  migrated  together,  and  it  sometimes  returns  migrants  to  dangerous border cities without their belongings (de len 2013; slack et al.


2013).
operation streamline  one prominent component of consequence delivery is operation streamline, which chief  fisher  describes  as  a  consequence-based  prosecution  program  (fisher  2011b).


under  streamline, unauthorized border-crossers are prosecuted in group trials and convicted of  illegal entry into the country, which is a misdemeanor.
if they cross again, they may be  convicted of a felony and face up to two years in prison (lydgate 2010, 481-544).


although  these offenses have been on the books since 1929, they are being applied under operation  streamline more widely than ever before (keller 2010, 65-139).
the structure of operation  streamlinein which 80 or more immigrants are tried at one time, and each defendant  has only a few minutes of access to an attorneycompromises due process.


moreover,  streamline  has  severely  strained  the  capacities  of  courtrooms  along  the  border  and  clogged the courts with petty immigration offenses (lydgate 2010, 481-544).
according to  department of justice data analyzed by the transactional records access clearinghouse  (trac), immigration prosecutions reached an all-time high in fy 2013 of 97,384 (of  which 53,789 were for illegal entry and 37,346 for illegal re-entry).


this marks an  increase of 367 percent over the number of prosecutions 10 years earlier (trac 2013a).
collateral damage in addition to deporting non-violent immigrants en masse, the border patrols tactics and  priorities also manage to drive unauthorized immigrants to their death.


this was the case  even before implementation of the prevention through deterrence strategy (bailey, et al.
1996, 16-20; massey, et al.


2002, 113-14).
however, since the dawn of the prevention  through deterrence era in 1994, the number of deaths has surged as smugglers lead their  clients through increasingly isolated and dangerous terrain in order to evade heightened  us border enforcement.


the border patrol recorded 5,570 migrant deaths from fy 1998  to fy 2012 (border patrol 2013).
as border enforcement resources were concentrated in  california and texas beginning in the early 1990s, more and more migrants began crossing  into the united states through arizonaand dying there.


according to the pima county  office of the medical examiner, 2,238 migrants died in just the tucson sector of the us- mexico border from fy 1990 to fy 2012 (martnez, et al.
2013).


2 2  the data in figures 3 and 4 do not include estimates of fatalities on the mexico side of the us-mexico  border.

a  2013  investigation  by  the  arizona  republic  found  that,  since  2005,  on-duty  border  patrol  agents and customs and border protection officers have killed at least 42 people, including  at least 13 americans (ortega and odell 2013).


according to journalists bob ortega and  rob odell, the shootings vary from strongly justifiable to highly questionable, and in  none of the cases is any agent or officer publicly known to have faced consequencesnot  from the border patrol, not from customs and border protection or homeland security, not  from the department of justice, and not, ultimately, from criminal or civil courts (ortega  and odell 2013).
in addition, a 2013 report by the police executive research forum  (perf) raised serious concerns about the use of deadly force by cbp officers and agents,  in particular with regard to shots fired at vehicles and shots fired at subjects throwing  rocks and other objects (perf 2013).


the report advised, among other things, that cbp  personnel should be prohibited from shooting at vehicles unless vehicle occupants are  attempting to use deadly forceother than the vehicle, and that officers and agents should  be prohibited from using deadly force against subjects throwing objects not capable of  causing serious physical injury or death (perf 2013, 2).
in 2014, cbp released a new  use of force handbook that incorporated some of perfs recommendations, but fell short  of comprehensively revising its use-of-force policies (cbp 2014b).


in  a  related  vein,  research  has  documented  physical  abuse  of  deportees  during  their  apprehension or detention by cbp and ice.
a survey conducted between 2009 and 2012 by  the migrant border crossing study3 found that 11 percent of recent deportees interviewed  in mexico reported being hit, pushed, grabbed, or physically attacked while in us custody  (martnez, slack, and heyman 2013, 1-4).


likewise, a 2011 report by no more deaths  found that 10 percent of deportees reported physical abuse at the hands of us authorities  (no more deaths 2011).
and a study of salvadoran deportees from 1999 to 2000 found an  abuse rate of 16 percent (phillips, rodrguez, and hagan 2002, 285-306).


taken together,  these studies indicate the abuse of far more people than the relative handful who report  mistreatment to the dhs office for civil rights and civil liberties, which received 58  cases of civil rights violations by cbp officers and 174 by ice agents in fy 2012 (dhs  2013, 33).
pending policy proposals for border enforcement  fatalities and human rights violations notwithstanding, it seems likely that prevention  through  deterrence  could  remain  a  cornerstone  of  us  border  enforcement.


escalating  levels  of  concentrated  border  enforcement  are  central  to  both  the  comprehensive  immigration reform bill passed by the senate in june 2013 and the border enforcement  bill that passed the house committee on homeland security in may 2013 (ewing 2013).
at  first  glance,  these  bills  might  seem  very  different.

208  journal on migration and human security1417 is an enforcement-only bill which does not even acknowledge the existence of any  other component of immigration reform (immigration policy center 2013; aila 2013).
yet the border enforcement provisions of the bills are very similar.


both share the arbitrary  and possibly unverifiable goals of operational control over the entire southwest border  (defined as a 90 percent deterrence rate), as well as 100 percent situational awareness  (persistent surveillance).
the senate bill also extended border security provisions through  the corker-hoeven, or border surge, amendment, which seeks to aggressively expand  border security operations and would appropriate tens of billions of dollars in additional  funding, and hire 19,200 additional border patrol agents, before dhs has even determined  what resource and staffing levels are needed.


likewise,  the  standards  for  immigration  reform  released  by  the  house  republican  leadership  in  january  2014  also  would  seem  to  suggest  a  continuation  of  the  existing  enforcement-first style of border control.
the one-page statement asserts that:  it is the fundamental duty of any government to secure its borders, and the united  states is failing in this mission.


we must secure our borders now and verify that they  are secure.
in addition, we must ensure now that when immigration reform is enacted,  there will be a zero tolerance policy for those who cross the border illegally or overstay  their visas in the future.


(boehner 2014)  in perpetuating and expanding this model of border control, lawmakers are failing to address  the need for greater accountability of the law enforcement agencies that are responsible for  border security, a problem which culminates in human rights abuses.
beyond the border the policies and practices of the border patrol do not exist in isolation.


rather, border  security operations have expanded in tandem with interior enforcement measures as part of  a broader national initiative.
since the creation of dhs in 2003, the annual budget of cbp  (which includes the border patrol) doubled from $5.


9 billion to $11.
9 billion in fy 2013.


spending on ice grew 73 percent, from $3.
3 billion since its inception to $5.


9 billion in  fy 2013 (dhs 2014).
in addition to the growing ranks of border patrol agents, the number  of cbp officers staffing ports of entry grew from 17,279 in fy 2003 to 21,423 in fy 2012  (cbp 2012).


the number of ice agents devoted to enforcement and removal operations  more than doubled from 2,710 in fy 2003 to 6,338 in fy 2012 (ice 2013).
all told, the  number  of  border  and  interior  enforcement  personnel  now  stands  at  more  than  49,000  (border patrol 2012; cbp 2012; ice 2013).


secure communities  the growth of ice over the past decade is most apparent in the dramatic expansion of one  interior immigration enforcement program, secure communities.
this dhs program, now  activated in all 3,181 jurisdictions across the united states, uses biometric data to screen for  deportable immigrants as people are being booked into jails, regardless of whether or not  they are actually charged with or convicted of crimes (ice 2013; rosenblum and kandel  2012, 15-16).

if there is  an immigration hit, ice can issue a detainer requesting that the jail hold the person  in question until ice can pick them up.
secure communities has grown to encompass  every  part  of  the  country,  throwing  more  and  more  people  into  immigration  detention  prior to deportation (waslin 2011).


most of the immigrants being scooped up by secure  communities are non-violent and not a threat to anyone.
ice data analyzed by trac  indicate that  no more than 14 percent of the detainers issued by the government in fy 2012 and the first four months of fy 2013 met the agencys stated goal of targeting individuals  who pose a serious threat to public safety or national security.


in fact, roughly half of  the 347,691 individuals subject to an ice detainer (47.
7 percent) had no record of a  criminal conviction, not even a minor traffic violation.


(trac 2013b)  given  that  secure  communities  is  mostly  targeting  people  who  do  not  threaten  public  safety,  more  than  one  hundred  cities  and  counties  around  the  country  are  refusing  to  honor ice detainers unless the individual in question has been arrested for a serious crime  (linthicum 2014).
the failure to deter unauthorized immigration through  enforcement policies ironically, at the same time immigration enforcement has gone into overdrive, apprehensions  along the us-mexico border have fallen to their lowest levels in decades (simanski and sapp  2013, 3).


the border patrol is at times quick to take credit for this dramatic decline, acting  as if it were caused principally by the deterrent effect of their border enforcement programs  (fisher 2011b).
but it is not a coincidence that the greatest drop in apprehensions started  with the economic downturn which began in late 2007 and which reduced labor demand  throughout the us economy (passel, cohn, and gonzalez-barrera 2013, 9).


the fact is that  the federal government has been trying without success to curb unauthorized immigration  through enforcement-only policies for a long time.
since the last major overhaul of the us  immigration system in 1986, the federal government has spent an estimated $186.


8 billion  dollars on immigration enforcement (meissner, et al.
2013, 3).


but this expenditure did  not keep unauthorized immigrants out of the united states, nor persuade them to leave,  because the 1986 reforms failed to create legal channels of immigration that could keep up  with us labor demand, or the need for family reunification.
perhaps a more realistic measure of how effective enforcement programs have been in  meeting their goal, both at the border and in the interior of the country, is the number of  unauthorized immigrants living in the united states.


this  number has  tripled from  3.
5  million in 1990 (just prior to the initiation of prevention through deterrence) to 11.


7  million in 2012 (passel, cohn, and gonzalez-barrera 2013, 9).
in part, this increase reflects  the fact that as many as half of unauthorized immigrants may enter the country on valid  visas and then stay after their visas expire.


for these immigrants, border enforcement is  not a deterrent to entering the united states.
but the persistent presence and growth of the  unauthorized population also reflects the degree to which it has become part of us society.


according to dhs estimates, roughly three-fifths of all unauthorized immigrants have been   212  journal on migration and human security   2 1 0 2 - 0 9 9 1  , .

moreover,  according to the pew research center, close to one million unauthorized immigrants are  children, while 4.
5 million native-born, us citizen children have at least one parent who  is unauthorized (passel and cohn 2011).


these are people who have roots in this country  and are likely to stay when faced with escalating immigration enforcement (filindra 2012).
one  of  the  grim  side  effects  of  the  current  border  enforcement  system  is  how  it  fuels  the human smuggling business.


migrants now depend upon the services of smugglers to  guide them between (or through) ports of entry into the united states.
but as demand for  smugglers has increased, so have the prices they charge.


as a result, the profitability of  human smuggling has become so great as to attract the interest of drug cartels that are  taking control of prized smuggling routes.
migrants not only fear the border patrol, but  are also subject to abuses at the hands of the smugglers they pay to help them evade the  border patrol (goddard 2012; heyman 2011; heyman 2014, 120-24).


women and girls  in  particular  are  at  high  risk  of  being  raped  or  abandoned  in  the  desert  by  smugglers  (oleary 2012, 143-44).
prescriptions for change a  first  step  toward  improving  the  negative  consequences  of  concentrated  yet  poorly- focused border enforcement is to increase accountability within the border patrol and the  cbp more broadly.


at present, it is difficult to ascertain if and when border patrol agents  and cbp officers are disciplined or even investigated when allegations of misconduct are  lodged against them.
this shroud of secrecy must be lifted and investigations conducted  within full view of the public.


more importantly, allegations of misconduct must be subject  to  third-party  monitoring  and  review  to  ensure  some  degree  of  neutrality.
in  addition,  substantial revisions are needed in the cbp use of force policy handbook, and in the  training of cbp officers, to prevent the use of excessive force in the first place (aclu  2014).


the culture of cbp must emphasize respect for the human rights of all people, be  they us citizens or unauthorized border-crossers.
this means that excessive force should  never be tolerated, and deadly force never be used to protect property.


in the end, cbp  should have a mission comparable to that of any police department: protecting the public  (perf 2013, 10).
and it should be the norm rather than the exception that a border patrol  agent who abuses someone stands trial and faces prison time.


however, no amount of reform within cbp can compensate for the fact that us immigration  law and policy is out of balance.
the growing criminalization of both legally present and  unauthorized  immigrants  is  a  systemic  problem  that  requires  a  systemic  fix.


from  the  standpoint of public safety, the primary aim of law enforcement in general, both at the  border and in the interior of the country, should be the capture of dangerous criminals,  and not the pursuit of unauthorized border crossers or lawful permanent residents with  misdemeanors on their records.
in other words, the legal definitions of who qualifies as a  criminal alien and who does not must be rewritten (stumpf  2006, 367-419; american  immigration council 2013).


of paramount importance from a law enforcement perspective  is dismantling the transnational criminal organizations that smuggle people, drugs, guns,  and money across the us-mexico border.
targeting those criminal organizations would  serve to enhance public safety and national security far more than the mass detention of   214  journal on migration and human securityunauthorized  immigrants,  the  vast  majority  of  whom  do  not  pose  a  threat  of  any  kind  (goddard 2012; heyman 2011).


border security would also be greatly enhanced through immigration reform that effectively  drains the sea of unauthorized immigrants within which dangerous criminals hide (ewing  2007,  429).
this  would  be  accomplished  by  creating  a  readily  accessible  pathway  to  legal status for the current unauthorized population.


in addition, establishing sufficiently  flexible avenues for employment-based and family-based immigration would ensure that  the  country  does  not  face  the  same  problems  yet  again  in  future  decades  (giovagnoli  2013,  4-8;  immigration  policy  center  2010).
until  the  united  states  has  a  functional  immigration system, no immigration enforcement policy will work, no matter how much  money is poured into it.


and as long as unauthorized immigration exists on a large scale,  transnational criminal organizations stand to make billions of dollars each year by coming  up with new ways to circumvent us border defenses.
it also is important to keep in mind that border communities bear the brunt of poorly- conceived  federal  enforcement  policies  which  should  be  protecting  the  people  who  live along the border rather than targeting them.


many of the conflicts between border  residents and federal officials could be avoided if border communities were involved in  the  formulation  and  implementation  of  border  enforcement  policies,  as  well  as  longer-term  strategies  to  develop  border  regions.
for  instance,  nongovernmental  organizations based along the border have for years been calling for citizen review boards  to  provide  local  oversight  of  federal  border  enforcement  personnel.


they  have  also  advocated for focusing federal resources on modernizing ports of entry rather than simply  fortifying the vast stretches of land between ports of entry.
in short, residents of border  regions view their communities as a vibrant resource rather than just an enforcement zone  to be policed by federal agents (border network for human rights and border action  network 2008; heyman 2013).


finally,  lawmakers  in  the  united  states  must  begin  to  consider  the  ways  in  which  us  trade, investment, and international development policies impact migration from sending  countries.
for instance, the north american free trade agreement (nafta) was crafted  and implemented in such a way as to drive many small farmers out of business in mexico.


without a means of subsistence, and with insufficient numbers of jobs available in urban  areas, these former farmers have few options but to head north to the united states.
if the  federal government seeks to control unauthorized migratory flows in the long run, it must  pursue economic policies that promote the creation of jobs in sending countries rather than  exacerbating unemployment (bacon 2013).


conclusion us policies governing immigration, trade, and international development are very much  intertwined, and they must all incorporate the concept of human security.
if people are  driven from their home countries by economic necessity (created, in part, by us policies),  drawn to the united states by labor demand, and confronted by unrealistic limits on legal  immigration, then dangerous forms of unauthorized immigration are the inevitable result.


unauthorized migrants who make it through the gauntlet of us border enforcement face   215  immigration enforcement in the us-mexico borderlands a  precarious  existence  of  unlawful  presence  within  the  united  states.
they  can  be  apprehended and deported by immigration agents at any time, and their upward economic  mobility  and  social  integration  are  severely  limited.


it  would  be  far  more  humane  and  practical  for  the  us  government  to  enact  policies  which  encourage  job  creation  in  the  home countries of unauthorized immigrants, to create an accessible pathway to legal status  for those unauthorized immigrants already living in the united states, and allow limits on  legal immigration to rise and fall in accordance with economic conditions.
moreover, us  border enforcement policies must become more tightly focused on the apprehension of  terrorists and dangerous criminals, and the disruption of transnational smuggling networks,  rather than on seizing as many unauthorized immigrants as possible.
