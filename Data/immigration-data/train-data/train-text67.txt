the syrian refugee crisis: a  comparison of responses by  germany, sweden, the united  kingdom, and the united states   nicole ostrand1  executive summary the  conflict  in  syria  between  the  government  of  bashar  al-assad  and  various other forces, which started in the spring of 2011, continues to cause  displacement within the country and across the region.
by the end of 2014,  an estimated 7.


6 million people were internally displaced and 3.
7 million  syrians had fled the country since the conflict began (ocha 2014; unhcr  2015a).


the refugee situation caused by the syrian conflict is dire, and it  has placed enormous strain on neighboring countries.
lebanon, jordan,  iraq, egypt,  and turkey host massive  numbers of syrian refugees, and  syrians have been seeking protection beyond these countries in increasing  numbers since 2011.


this paper looks at the burdens and costs of the syrian refugee crisis and  considers how they have, or have not, been shared by the international  community at large, and in particular by germany, sweden, the united  kingdom, and the united states.
it also considers to what degree syrians  have been able to find protection in states outside the region.


germany  and sweden, by the end of 2014, had provided protection to the largest  number of syrian refugees outside the region.
although germany, sweden,  the united kingdom, and the united states differ in the level of protection  provided to syrians, all four states have increased protection to syrians via  resettlement and asylum (and in the case of the us temporary protected  status) since 2012.


despite this, the degree of protection provided by the  four states is modest in relation to that provided by neighboring countries  to  syria,  and  far  more  could  be  done.
this  paper  also  argues  that  the  international community as a whole has not sufficiently contributed toward  alleviating the burden caused by the syrian refugee influx, in terms of both  financial assistance and refugee resettlement.

jmhs volume 3 number 3 (2015): 255-279the  paper  puts  forward  two  general  recommendations  to  reduce  the  strain on neighboring countries: increase the level of burden sharing by  the international community as a whole and more evenly distribute the  burden  among  industrialized  states  in  europe,  north  america,  and  the  asia pacific.
in terms of enhancing the level of protection for syrians in  countries beyond the region, it proposes three recommendations for states:  namely,  increase  refugee  resettlement,  facilitate  family  reunification  and other forms of legal admission, and allow refugees to seek protection  through embassies in the region.


introduction  the conflict in syria between the government of bashar al-assad and various other forces,  which started in the spring of 2011, continues to cause displacement within the country  and across the region.
by the end of 2014, an estimated 7.


6 million people were internally  displaced and 3.
7 million syrians had fled the country since the conflict began (ocha  2014; unhcr 2015a).


during 2014, more than one million syrians were newly registered  as refugees in neighboring countries, bringing the total number of registered refugees in the  region to 3,688,402 by year-end (unhcr 2014a; unhcr 2015a).
2 as large as the number  of newly registered refugees is, in a sense it underestimates the current crisis as it excludes  the 117,590 syrians who were awaiting registration at the end of 2014 (unhcr 2015a),  and de facto syrian refugees who were residing in the region but who were not formally  registered or awaiting registration.


3  the syrian conflict has placed enormous strain on its neighboring countries, with jordan,  lebanon,  and  turkey  shouldering  the  largest  burden.
by  the  end  of  2014,  lebanon,  a  country of approximately 4.


8 million people before the onset of the syrian refugee crisis,  hosted 1,146,405 registered syrian refugees, meaning that nearly one in every five people  now living in lebanon is a syrian refugee (unhcr 2015a).
as of december 31, 2014,  turkey hosted the largest syrian population, with 1,552,839 registered refugees; jordan  housed the third largest population with 622,865 registered refugees (ibid.


).
in comparison,  iraq and egypt accommodated a smaller yet substantial number of syrians, hosting 228,484  and 137,812 registered refugees, respectively (ibid.


).
mara eugenia casar, under secretary general and associate administrator of the united  nations development programme (undp), has reported that countries hosting syrian  refugees  are  struggling  with  the  massive  impact  on  their  economies,  societies,  and  infrastructure  threatening  not  only  their  stability  but  the  stability  of  the  entire  region  (cited in unhcr 2014b).


the scope and protracted nature of the syrian conflict has made   2   on january 1, 2014, there were 2,301,533 registered syrian refugees (unhcr 2014a).
estimates include  24,055 syrian refugees registered in north africa (unhcr 2015a).


3   the number of newly registered syrian refugees also excludes refugees who are not syrian nationals  but who were residing as refugees in syria prior to the conflict and who have fled due to the fighting.
such  populations include palestinian and iraqi refugees.


for example, the united nations relief and works agency  for palestine refugees estimates that 65,000 palestinian refugees have left syria and are now residing in  lebanon, jordan, gaza, and egypt (unrwa 2015).
similarly, early reports had estimated that more than  50,000 iraqi refugees living in syria returned to iraq (see http://www.


unhcr.org/51c0399c9.
html).


256  journal on migration and human securitythe situation for syrian refugees and their host communities exceedingly difficult.
syrian  refugees  face  tension  among  host  community  populations  and  struggle  to  secure  basic  needs like security, food, and shelter (orhan 2014).


with the humanitarian situation caused  by the syrian conflict continuing to deteriorate, syrians are increasingly seeking asylum in  states outside the region.
in 2013, syria became for the first time the main country of origin of asylum seekers in 44  industrialized countries in europe, north america, and the asia pacific region (unhcr  2014d).


4 an  estimated  56,400  syrians  requested  refugee  status  in  the  44  industrialized  countries in 2013, more than double the number of syrian asylum claims in 2012 (25,200)  and six times the number in 2011 (8,500) (ibid.
).


in 2014, the number of syrian asylum  seekers in the 44 industrialized countries reached 149,600, the highest number recorded by  a single group since 1992 (unhcr 2015h).
5  the refugee situation caused by the syrian conflict is dire.


lebanon, jordan, iraq, egypt,  and turkey host massive numbers of syrian refugees, and syrians are increasingly seeking  protection outside these countries as well.
this paper looks at the burdens and costs of  the syrian refugee crisis and considers how they have, or have not, been shared by the  international  community  at  large,  and  in  particular  by  germany,  sweden,  the  united  kingdom, and the united states.


these  four  states  were  chosen  as  a  focal  point  because  they  accommodate  relatively  large numbers of asylum seekers annually and enjoy a positive reputation for providing  refuge to those in need in times of crisis.
6 according to unhcrs annual asylum trends  reports of 44 industrialized states, between 2009 and 2013, germany, sweden, the united  kingdom, and the united states ranked among the top five states receiving asylum claims  (unhcr 2014d, 13).


7 each country has also demonstrated a significant commitment to  alleviating the syrian refugee crisis.
the united states and the united kingdom are the  4   the 44 countries are the 28 member states of the european union (eu), albania, bosnia and herzegovina,  iceland,  liechtenstein,  montenegro,  norway,  serbia,  switzerland,  the  former  yugoslav  republic  of  macedonia,  and turkey,  as  well  as australia,  canada,  japan,  new  zealand,  the  republic  of  korea,  and  the united states (unhcr 2014d, 5).


note: even though turkey is included in the 44 countries, the vast  majority of syrians who are registered in the country (and who are covered by the turkish governments  temporary protection regime) are not included in unhcrs estimates of asylum seekers in the country.
the  syrian asylum seekers included in unhcrs estimates cover only those who for specific reasons have been  referred to unhcr for further evaluation of their international protection needs (unhcr 2015h, 21).


5    in  1992,  223,000  people  originating  from  serbia  and  montenegro  lodged  asylum  claims  in  the  44  industrialized countries included in unhcrs annual asylum trends reports (unhcr 2015h).
6   for instance, the united states is well-known for being the worlds top refugee resettlement country and  generally resettles at least 50 percent of all refugees referred by unhcr annually worldwide (see, e.


g.
,  unhcr 2015c and us prm 2014).


in 2014 the british deputy prime minister, nick clegg, said: [w]e are  one of the most open-hearted countries in the world and i believe we have a moral responsibility to help  britain has a long and proud tradition of providing refuge at times of crisis (cited in wintour 2014, emphasis  added).
sweden has a reputation for being particularly open and receptive toward syrian refugees (see, e.


g.
,  brennen 2013; evans 2014; and rothschild 2014).


germany views the fundamental right of asylum as a high  priority that expresses the countrys willingness to fulfill its historical and humanitarian obligation to admit  refugees (german federal ministry of the interior 2014a).
7   the united states had the most asylum claims submitted during this period, followed by germany.


sweden  and the united kingdom received the fourth and fifth largest number of asylum claims.
france, which ranked  third, is not considered in this report due to the minimal number of syrian asylum claims made in the country  in 2012, 2013, and 2014.


257  the syrian refugee crisislargest single-state bilateral donors of humanitarian aid for the syrian crisis (pierce 2014),  and germany and sweden have admitted the largest number of syrian refugees among  industrialized states outside the region.
8 through a comparison of these four countries, this  paper illustrates how some industrialized states have responded to the syrian refugee influx  and draws attention to differences and similarities in their responses.


after comparing the contributions and responses of industrialized states to each other and  to the contributions and responses of syrias neighboring states, this paper puts forward  two  types  of  recommendations.
first,  to  reduce  the  strain  on  neighboring  countries,  it  recommends  increasing  the  level  of  burden  sharing  by  the  international  community  as  a whole as well as increasing the distribution of this burden among industrialized states.


second, to enhance the level of protection available for syrians in states beyond the region,  this paper recommends that states: (1) increase refugee resettlement; (2) allow refugees  to seek protection through embassies in the region; and (3) facilitate family reunification  and other legal avenues for admission, such as private sponsorship, medical evacuation,  humanitarian visas, academic scholarships, and labor mobility schemes.
asylum,  refugee  resettlement,  and  temporary   i.


protection  there are two primary avenues for syrians to access protection in industrialized states  beyond the region: (1) traveling (legally or illegally) to a state and claiming asylum there,  or  (2)  being  recognized  as  a  refugee  for  resettlement  selection  from  a  country  of  first  asylum.
these avenues are complementary, and the main difference is the location of the  person at the time of application.


refugee determinations and resettlement decisions are  made while the person is outside the destination country (unhcr 2011, 3).
9 in contrast, a  person seeking asylum submits an application while they are physically present in or at a  port of entry in the territory where they are requesting refuge.


10  no country is legally obliged to resettle refugees, and only a few states offer resettlement  on a regular basis (unhcr 2011).
less than 1 percent of the worlds refugees are resettled  to a third country (unhcr 2015c).


asylum is a form of protection based on the principle  of non-refoulement and internationally or nationally recognized refugee rights (eurostat   8   see analysis below for the number of syrians provided protection in germany and sweden compared  to the united states and united kingdom.
see bitoulas 2013, 2014, and 2015 for the number of syrians  provided asylum in germany and sweden compared to other eu member states.


additionally, canada and  australia have only offered resettlement and other forms of admission to around 11,000 and 5,600 syrians,  respectively (unhcr 2015b), and they have received a very small number of syrian asylum seekers (see  unhcr 2014d).
9   unhcr defines refugee resettlement as the selection and transfer of refugees from a [s]tate in which  they have sought protection to a third [s]tate which has agreed to admit them, as refugees, for permanent  resettlement (unhcr 2011, 3).


the status and rights given to resettled refugees vary depending on the  country, and some states (e.
g.


, germany) initially grant temporary residence with the possibility to receive  permanent residence after a specified length of time.

states have an obligation to provide protection.


a positive asylum decision can  lead to refugee status11 (referred to as asylum in the united states), subsidiary protection  status,12 or withholding of removal.
13 temporary protection, which grants the right to enter or remain in a country for a limited  time due to risk of serious harm in a persons home country, is another possible means for  providing protection.


14 it is usually granted to large groups of people based on extraordinary  and temporary conditions in their country of origin (miller and orchard 2014).
temporary  protection  is  not  intended  to  displace  asylum,  but  rather  to  provide  an  intermediary,  immediate measure of protection, and persons granted temporary protection should be able  to apply for and be granted asylum if eligible (kerwin 2014).


15 in the eu, temporary protection generally refers to a procedure to provide, in the event  of a mass influx or imminent mass influx, immediate and temporary protection to persons  fleeing their country who are unable to return home (european commission 2015b).
16 since  2001, the eu has had a regional temporary protection mechanism which is triggered by the  adoption of a decision by the council of the european union (following a recommendation  by the european commission) establishing a mass influx of displaced persons and stating  the groups of persons to whom the protection applies.


17 in the united states, temporary   11   eu directive 2011/95/eu, article 2(e); us ina, section 101(a)(42)(a), section 208(a), and section 208(b).
12   eu directive 2011/95/eu, article 2(g).


in the eu, subsidiary protection status is granted to a third country  national (or a stateless person) who does not qualify as a refugee but for whom substantial grounds have  been shown for believing that the person concerned, if returned to his or her country of origin, would face  a  real  risk  of  suffering  serious  harm.
a  positive  asylum  decision  in  the  eu  can  also  grant  authorization  to stay for humanitarian reasons.


this includes individuals who are not eligible for refugee or subsidiary  protection, but are nonetheless protected against removal under obligations imposed on all eu member states  by international refugee or human rights law.
examples of such categories are persons who are not removable  on ill health grounds and unaccompanied minors (bitoulas 2014, 24).


no syrians were granted authorization  to stay for humanitarian reasons by germany, sweden, or the united kingdom in 2013 through 2014 (see  bitoulas 2014 and bitoulas 2015).
13   us ina, section 241(b)(3) and section 241(c).


withholding of removal is a form of protection in the  united states that is considered once an asylum seeker is determined not to meet the refugee definition.
it is  granted to individuals who show that they would either be tortured or they would face persecution on account  of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion if returned to their  country of origin.


in the united states, withholding applicants face higher standards of proof than asylum  seekers (kerwin 2012).
14   eu directive 2001/55/ec; us ina, section 244(b)(1).


for more on temporary protection in general, see  edwards 2012.
15   see also eu directive 2001/55/ec, paragraph 10 and articles 4 and 19.


16    see  also  the  council  of  the  european  union  directive  on  minimum  standards  for  giving  temporary  protection (eu directive 2001/55/ec).
17   eu directive 2001/55/ec.


it should be noted that there are other forms of temporary protection and some  eu member states, in addition to being part of the regional temporary protection regime, offer distinct forms  of temporary protection at the national level.
for example, germany and the united kingdom technically  grant temporary protection for syrians admitted through their resettlement programs.


however, this is not  discussed in the section on temporary protection because it is covered in the resettlement portion of the paper.
in the united kingdom, syrians receive temporary residency for five years; following this period, individuals  may apply for permanent settlement (uk home office 2013; uk home office 2014a).


syrians admitted  under germanys resettlement program receive two-year, potentially renewable residence permits (miller  and orchard 2014).
additionally, syrians granted asylum in germany (both subsidiary and refugee status)  receive a three-year residency permit, after which they are granted permanent residency provided that they   259  the syrian refugee crisisprotection is often associated with temporary protected status, which offers group protection  to non-citizens in the united states from designated countries.


18 temporary protected status  is not necessarily a response to a mass influx, but is granted to individuals of designated  states  when  an  armed  conflict,  a  natural  disaster,  or  other  extraordinary  and  temporary  conditions prevent them from returning.
19  ii.


limitations comparing refugee and asylum numbers across states can be challenging because states  have different laws, systems, and procedures for admitting refugees.
20 also, the information  available  varies  by  state  and  there  is  inconsistency  in  definitions  and  terms.


there  are  three important limitations pertinent to the evaluation of syrian refugees across germany,  sweden, the united kingdom, and the united states.
first, there is a disparity in how the number of submitted asylum applications is calculated  by states.


statistics on asylum applications in germany, sweden, and the united kingdom  refer to the number of individuals applying for asylum, irrespective of the type of procedure  in which the application was lodged (eurostat 2014b).
in the united states, data on asylum  applications are broken down by type: affirmative and defensive.


affirmative claims refer  to applications by persons who are not in removal proceedings and who come forward  affirmatively  to  request  protection.
defensive  claims,  on  the  other  hand,  are  submitted  for  the  first  time  as  a  defense  to  removal  by  persons  who  are  in  removal  proceedings  (kerwin  2012).


information  on  affirmative  claims  are  reported  by  the  us  citizenship  and immigration services (uscis) and refer to the number of cases, which may include  several individuals from the same family.
in contrast, statistics on defensive applications  are reported by the executive office for immigration review (eoir) and count the number  of individuals.


as a result of differences in the way us asylum applications are reported, it is difficult  to  establish  the  actual  number  of  syrians  requesting  asylum  annually  (including  both  affirmative and defensive claims).
this makes it challenging to compare the united states  with germany, sweden, and the united kingdom.


according to unhcr, on average one  affirmative asylum case in the united states involves 1.
356 individuals (unhcr 2014d,   do not meet the conditions for revocation or withdrawal (german residence act, section 26[1] and 26[3]).


18   the  united  states  also  has  other  mechanisms  that  can  offer  temporary  protection.
for  example,  the  department of homeland security can use parole to grant entry to non-citizens, who would otherwise be  inadmissible, based on a compelling emergency or urgent humanitarian reason (uscis 2014b; us ina  212(d)(5)(a)).


for more on temporary protection programs in the united states see kerwin 2014.
19   us ina, section 244(b)(1).


for more on temporary protected status in the united states, see bergeron  2014.
20   as members of the eu, germany, sweden, and the united kingdom, in theory, have a more harmonized  system of procedures and legislation on asylum.


since 1999, eu member states have worked to establish a  common european asylum system, or a set of common asylum policies and standards at the eu level.
(it  should be noted that the united kingdom is not fully part of the common european asylum system.


for  more information, see costello and hancox 2014, 4-5).
this system is intended to bring unified standards and  to strengthen practical cooperation between member states.


it consists of several directives and regulations  that detail the responsibilities of eu member states in receiving asylum seekers, processing their claims, and  providing protection.
260  journal on migration and human security5).


to produce an estimate of the number of individuals who submitted asylum applications  in the united states, this paper will therefore multiply by 1.
356 the reported number of  us  affirmative  applications  and  add  to  that  product  the  number  of  defensive  asylum  applications submitted annually.


a second limitation relates to who is included in statistics on individuals granted asylum  in each state.
in the eu, a person granted asylum (referred to as a recipient of international  protection), means an individual who has received refugee or subsidiary protection status  (bitoulas  2015,  23).


21  subsidiary  protection  (known  as  humanitarian  protection  in  the  united kingdom) is provided to a person who does not qualify as a refugee but for whom  there are substantial grounds to believe they would face a risk of serious harm if returned to  his or her country of origin.
22 throughout this paper, a syrian granted asylum in germany,  sweden, and the united kingdom refers to a recipient of international protection23 and  includes those who have received refugee or subsidiary protection status.


in the united states, a person granted asylum (an asylee) generally refers to persons who  received protection based on the refugee standard and does not include related forms of  protection such as withholding of removal (martin and yankay 2014).
24 withholding of  removal claims are considered after an individual has been denied asylum.


withholding is  granted to individuals who show that they would either be tortured if returned to his or her  country of origin or it is more likely than not that they would face persecution on account  of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.
25  due to the limitations of available information, data relating to syrians granted asylum in  the united states includes only individuals who received protection based on the refugee  standard.


while statistics are available on the number of individuals granted withholding of  removal under the us immigration and nationality act (ina) and under the un convention  against torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment (cat),  they do not distinguish individuals granted this status by nationality.
however, because the  number of withholding grants annually is small in comparison to the number of asylum  grants, it is assumed the absence of withholding statistics for syrian nationals will not  make a substantial difference in the overall picture of syrians provided protection in the  united states.


26   21   eu directive 2011/95/eu, article 2(b).
22   for subsidiary protection status see eu directive 2011/95/eu, article 2(g); for refugee status see eu  directive  2011/95/eu,  article  2(e).


humanitarian  protection  is  uks  equivalent  to  subsidiary  protection  (european database of asylum law 2015).
23   this paper uses the meaning of international protection as defined in the 2011 eu directive on the  standards for qualification of beneficiaries of international protection.


see eu directive 2011/95/eu, article  2(b).
24   to be eligible for asylum status, an applicant must meet the definition of a refugee set forth in us ina,  section 101(a)(42); see also us ina, section 208.


25   us ina, section 241(b)(3) and section 241(c).
26   for example, in fy 2013, 25,199 individuals received asylum in the united states (15,266 were granted  asylum by the uscis asylum office and 9,933 were granted asylum by immigration courts) compared to  1,893 individuals who were granted withholding of removal (1,518 who received withholding under us  ina, section 241(b)(3) and 375 who received withholding under cat).


see eoir 2014, k5 and m1; martin  and yankay 2014, table 6.
261  the syrian refugee crisisthe last limitation concerns the time period states use for reporting statistics.


statistics on  the number of asylum applications and individuals granted asylum in the united states are  based on its fiscal year (october 1 through september 30) while statistics from the three  european countries are based on the calendar year.
this and the other limitations discussed  make some of the numbers in this paper approximate but nonetheless sufficient to show  trends across the four states.


iii.
the syrian refugee crisis in neighboring countries  the  neighboring  countries  of turkey,  lebanon,  jordan,  iraq,  and  egypt  have  provided  valuable protection to syrian refugees since the conflict began in 2011.


they have generally  allowed syrians access to their territories and have dedicated significant financial resources  and social services to help them.
27 for example, turkey, by the start of december 2014, had  invested usd 4.


5 billion in direct assistance to syrian refugees in their country (guterres  2014).
as of mid-2014, jordan and lebanon had spent more than usd 1.


2 billion and  usd 1.
6 billion, respectively (undp 2014, 11).


the central iraqi government and regional  kurdistan government also contributed to the syrian refugee response by providing core  relief  items,  cash  assistance,  and  essential  services  (such  as  free  access  to  health  care)  (unhcr 2015f).
the burden placed on these countries is immense and has had adverse  social and economic costs on the host communities.


more  than  80  percent  of  registered  syrian  refugees  in  neighboring  countries  live  in  communities and cities rather than designated refugee camps.
the influx of large numbers  of refugees to urban settings has dramatically shifted the demographic composition in some  areas and strained basic social services like water, sanitation, food, health care, housing,  and electricity (undp 2014, 8).


a 2014 united nations development program (undp)  report described the refugee influx as a large-scale de facto acceleration of urban growth  which has not been matched by increases in housing, service provision, infrastructure, and  market capacity adequate to meet the requirements of the increased population (ibid.
, 8).


the areas and communities that were already among the poorest prior to the crisis (i.
e.


, the  northern region in jordan and in lebanon along the syrian border) have been particularly  hard hit.
they have had to absorb some of the largest numbers of refugees, yet have less  resources and wealth than towns and cities located farther away from the syrian border  (ibid.


).
in lebanon, a country with major development challenges that pre-dated the syrian refugee  crisis, the impact has been particularly devastating.


lebanon now has the highest per capita  rate of refugees worldwide (inter-agency 2015a).
since the start of the syrian conflict  in march 2011, the number of people residing in the country has increased by nearly 25  percent, and the people living under poverty has risen by nearly two-thirds (government of  lebanon and ocha 2014).


public institutions struggle to cope with the added volume of  demands for their services.
lebanese national health, education, and infrastructure services  are overstretched, and in some areas demand for electricity, water, and waste collection far  surpass the capacity to meet the needs (ibid.


).
27   recently, turkey, jordan, lebanon, and egypt have started to manage their borders in a more restrictive  manner  by  introducing  visa  requirements  for  syrians,  who  were  previously  exempt  from  this  regulation  (ayoub and khallaf 2014; echo 2014; usaid 2014).


262  journal on migration and human securityfor syrian refugees in lebanon, shelter is a serious concern due to the absence of formal  refugee camps and the lack of affordable housing (government of lebanon and ocha  2014, 85).
at the end of 2014, 55 percent of the 1,146,405 registered syrian refugees lived  in substandard shelter, mainly in informal settlements, garages, worksites, or unfinished  buildings  (ibid.


).
the  number  of  house  evictions  and  dismantling  of  informal  refugee  settlements has also increased, and an estimated 29 percent of syrians were unable to meet  their basic needs (echo 2015; government of lebanon and ocha 2014).


the situation in jordan is also dire.
in 2014, 84 percent of the 622,865 registered syrian  refugees lived in urban and rural areas across the country rather than in official refugee  camps (unhcr 2014e).


around two-thirds of the population outside camps in 2014 lived  below the jordanian absolute poverty line (usd 96 per month), and one-sixth were below  the abject poverty line (usd 40 per month) (ibid.
).


among the syrian households outside  camps, 46 percent were without heating and two-fifths had poor sanitary conditions (ibid.
).


in turkey, tension has been rising in cities and towns bordering syria due to the growing  syrian  population,  which  reached  1,552,839  registered  refugees  at  the  end  of  2014  (amnesty international 2014; unhcr 2014a).
more than 70 percent of these refugees  lived outside of government run refugee camps, often in overcrowded rental houses (inter- agency 2014a).


though camp settings provide basic services, many syrians outside of  camps struggle to secure basic needs like housing, health care, and education, and some  live in abject poverty, often in unsanitary, even dangerous housing conditions (amnesty  international 2014).
for  syrian  refugees  in  iraq  and  egypt,  changes  in  the  security  and  political  landscape  in each country have negatively impacted the refugees living conditions.


as the armed  conflicts  in  syria  and  iraq  have  intensified  and  become  intertwined,  the  situation  for  syrians in iraq has deteriorated (inter-agency 2014b).
in particular, humanitarian agencies  reported a deterioration of asylum space in 2013 in the kurdistan region, especially in the  erbil governorate where the authorities temporarily discontinued assistance and issuance  of  residency  permits  to  refugees  in  october  2013  (ibid.


).
28  although  assistance  and  issuance of residency permits was reinstituted in 2014, the security situation remains tense  in the central and northern region (inter-agency 2015b).


on top of the 228,484 registered  syrian refugees, two million iraqis were internally displaced by violence in 2014 alone,  overloading  the  resources  of  host  communities  who  accommodated  both  refugee  and  internally displaced populations (unhcr 2015f).
29  in egypt, despite the governments initial commitments to provide refugees with access to  public health and education on equal footing with egyptians, the protection available for  syrians has decreased due to a change in the political environment (inter-agency 2014c).


in july 2013, the egyptian government altered its policy and introduced visa requirements  for syrians, who had previously been exempt from this regulation (inter-agency 2014c).
30   28   the  regional  kurdistan  government  also  scaled  back  its  involvement  in  food  distribution  in  refugee  camps in 2013 (ibid.


).
29   around 95 percent of the registered syrian refugee population resides in the kurdistan region, an area  laden with high numbers of internally displaced.


30   before july 2013, syrians were exempt from prior-to-arrival visa requirements.
on arrival they received  a tourist visa and were allowed to stay for three months, after which they were required to regularize their  stay in the country.


263  the syrian refugee crisisthe  introduction  of  visa  requirements  has  significantly  limited  access  to  the  country  (ayoub and khallaf 2014).
additionally, hostility toward syrian refugees has increased,  particularly following the government regime change in july 2013 (ayoub and khallaf  2014; inter-agency 2014c).

the international communitys response   providing protection to syrian refugees  the number of syrians seeking asylum outside the region has increased over the last three  years, although it remains comparatively low.
around six percent of syrians (239,700)  who fled the country between 2011 and 2014 sought refuge in 44 industrialized states in  europe, north america, and the asia pacific region.


31 the vast majority sought protection  in  europe,  with  222,225  syrian  asylum  applications  submitted  in  37  european  states   31   the  estimated  number  of  syrians  who  sought  asylum  between  2011  and  2014  is  based  on  statistics  provided in unhcrs annual asylum trends reports (see unhcr 2013, 2014d, and 2015h).
for a list of the  44 industrialized states see supra note 3.


264  journal on migration and human securitybetween april 2011 and december 2014 (unhcr 2015e).
32 even though syrians, since  2013, have constituted the largest group of asylum seekers among the 44 industrialized  countries covered by unhcrs annual asylum trends reports, there remains a considerable  disparity in the number of syrians harbored in these countries compared to the millions of  refugees taken in by egypt, iraq, jordan, lebanon, and turkey.


one avenue for the international community to help alleviate the burden on neighboring  countries is through resettlement and other forms of admission.
33 as of january 9, 2015,  79,180 places had been offered for syrian refugees by 26 different states (unhcr 2015b).


34  this accounted for only two percent of the registered syrian refugee population living in  the  five  regional  countries  of  egypt,  jordan,  lebanon,  iraq, turkeyall  of  which  face  acute economic challenges, political instability, and significant security issues of their own.
several high income countries that have not offered resettlement include japan, kuwait,  qatar, russia, saudi arabia, and the united arab emirates.


additionally, china and india  have not offered any resettlement places.
a  rough  estimate  of  the  total  number  of  syrians  granted  protection  (including  refugee  resettlement, asylum, and temporary protection) in germany, sweden, the united kingdom,  and the united states, by the end of 2014, is 125,000.


35 this number is 3.
4 percent of the  total registered population in neighboring countries.


the total number of syrians granted  protection by these four states is less than the 137,812 registered syrians in egypt alone, the  regional state that hosted the fewest refugees at the end of 2014.
in comparison to turkey  and lebanon, the roughly 125,000 syrians given protection accounted for only eight and  eleven percent of the registered syrian refugee population in each country respectively.


financial support   international support for the syrian humanitarian situation has been largely financial.
the  european union has led the international community in aid for the syrian crisis (echo  2015).


collectively,  the  european  commission  and  its  member  states  dedicated  more  than  usd  3.
5  billion,  by  january  2015,  to  humanitarian,  development,  economic,  and  stabilization  assistance  to  internally  displaced  syrians  and  to  syrian  refugees  and  their  host communities in iraq, turkey, lebanon, jordan, and egypt (echo 2015; european  commission 2015a).


32   the countries are the 28 member states of the eu, albania, bosnia and herzegovina, iceland, liechtenstein,  montenegro, norway, serbia, switzerland, the former yugoslav republic of macedonia.
33   other forms of admission schemes include humanitarian visas, private sponsorship, family reunification,  scholarships, medical evacuation, and labor mobility programs (unhcr 2015b).


34   the states are argentina, australia, austria, belarus, belgium, brazil, canada, denmark, finland, france,  germany,  hungary,  ireland,  liechtenstein,  luxembourg,  netherlands,  new  zealand,  norway,  portugal,  poland, spain, sweden, switzerland, the united kingdom, the united states, and uruguay (unhcr 2015b).
35   this  approximation  is  derived  from  the  estimated  resettlement  places  made  available  for  syrians  by  each country (as of december 31, 2014), plus the number of syrians granted asylum by each country, and  the number of syrians who benefited from temporary protected status in the united states (as of january  2015).


the asylum numbers for the european countries are from 2012 through 2014.
the asylum numbers  for the united states are from fy 2012 through fy 2014 (note: the fy 2014 number for the united states is  estimated based on the number asylum cases approved during this period, see text below).


265  the syrian refugee crisisthe  united  states  and  united  kingdom  are  the  top  single-state  bilateral  donors  in  humanitarian aid for the syrian crisis (pierce 2014).
the united states has committed by  far the largest sum of humanitarian assistance to syria and its neighbors, contributing usd  2.


9 billion between fy 2012 and 2014 (usaid 2014; us prm 2014, 3).
more than usd  1.


4 billion of this amount was allocated to assist refugees and host communities in the  region (ibid).
the united kingdom, by february 2015, had committed usd 790 million in  aid to those affected by the syrian conflict (uk dfid 2015).


around usd 407 million was  provided specifically to help syrian refugees and host communities (ibid.
).


sweden and  germany have likewise provided financial assistance.
germany donated usd 448 million  in humanitarian aid for the syrian crisis from 2012 through 2014, and sweden contributed  usd 169 million in humanitarian and other assistance from march 2011 through october  28, 2014 (german federal ministry of interior 2014b; sweden ministry for foreign affairs  2014).


considerable amounts of aid have also been given by kuwait, saudi arabia, japan, and  canada.
for instance, kuwait was the third largest bilateral donor in 2014 (behind the  united  states  and  united  kingdom)  for  the  syrian  regional  refugee  response  plan,  the uns humanitarian program designed to assist syrian refugees and vulnerable host  communities (fts 2015).


36 germany was fourth followed by saudi arabia, japan, and  canada (ibid.
).


37 despite donations from governments and private actors, resources to aid the humanitarian  situation have been insufficient to address the needs of displaced syrians.
the amount of  aid from states and institutions for the syrian regional response plan reached only 61  percent of the estimated usd 3.


74 billion necessary to cover the needs for syrian refugees  and host communities in 2014 (unhcr 2015a).
38 the shortfall had negative implications  for many vulnerable syrians.


for instance, in early december 2014 the un world food programme (wfp) was forced  to temporarily suspend food assistance to more than 1.
7 million syrian refugees due to  inadequate funding resources (wfp 2014a).


though the wfp was able to resume its food  assistance following a fundraising campaign, there was a two-week period where hundreds  of  thousands  of  syrian  refugees  went  without  the  programs  assistance  (wfp  2014b).
unhcr also experienced a funding shortfall.


it received only 63 percent of the budget  required to cover needs for syrian refugees during 2014, leaving many vulnerable syrians  without assistance (unhcr 2015g).
39   36   the united states gave usd 823,421,815, the united kingdom gave usd 159,471,731, and kuwait gave  usd 149,273,450.


37   germany gave usd 131,190,965, saudi arabia gave usd 118,016,655, japan gave usd 91,622,781,  and canada gave usd 80,069,477.
38   the 2014 syria regional response plan brings together more than 155 actors to respond to the needs  caused by the syrian conflict.


the syrian regional response plan received 2.
27 billion, or 61 percent of its  budget, for 2014 (unhcr 2015a).


39   this estimate is for unhcrs work in the syrian regional response plan.
the united states was the top  donor to unhcr for its 2014 syrian regional response plan budget (usd 303 million), followed by the eu  (usd 149 million), kuwait (usd 93 million), germany (usd 42 million), and japan (usd 35 million).


the  united kingdom and sweden contributed usd 24 million and usd 1 million, respectively (unhcr 2015g).

comparison  between  germany,  sweden,  the  united  kingdom, and the united states  resettled syrian refugees  the  economic,  social,  and  human  cost  of  caring  for  refugees  and  the  internally  displaced  is  being  borne  mostly  by  poor  communities,  those  who  are  least  able  to  afford it.
enhanced international solidarity is a must if we want to avoid the risk of  more and more vulnerable people being left without proper support.


un high commissioner for refugees antnio guterres  (cited in unhcr 2015d)  refugee resettlement can serve as an important expression of international solidarity and  responsibility sharing, and it provides international protection to meet the specific needs of  vulnerable persons whose life, liberty, safety, health, or other fundamental rights are at risk  in the country where they have sought refuge (unhcr 2011).
in the context of the syrian  conflict, refugee resettlement is an important option as it offers protection to especially  vulnerable syrians and can relieve some of the burden placed on the neighboring countries  accommodating large numbers of syrian refugees.


unhcr estimates that more than 10  percent of the 3.
7 million registered syrian refugees in the region are individuals who are  acutely vulnerable and need resettlement elsewhere (guterres 2014; unhcr 2014c).


40   the number of syrian refugees who have been resettled to states outside the region is very  small in comparison to the refugees living in the region, and even smaller in comparison  to those who have fled syria but who have not been formally registered as refugees.
based  on  unhcrs  refugee  resettlement  database,  2,576  syrians  referred  by  unhcr  were  resettled to third countries from january 2012 through september 2014 (unhcr 2015i).


out of this number, 60 percent, or 1,576 refugees, were resettled to germany, sweden, the  united kingdom, and the united states (ibid.
).


germany resettled more than one-half of  this population (941 syrian refugees) while the united kingdom only resettled two percent  (34 syrian refugees) (ibid.
).


41 germany, sweden, the united kingdom, and the united states have each committed to  admit additional syrian refugees.
in march 2013, germany announced the initiation of a  program for admitting syrian refugees, primarily from lebanon.


syrians admitted through  this  program  receive  a  two-year  temporary  residence  permit  which  can  be  extended  consecutively (miller and orchard 2014, 58).
42 germanys national government has vowed  to  receive  20,000  syrian  refugees  through  this  program  (german  federal  ministry  of  interior 2014b).


in addition to this commitment, 15 of germanys states have initiated their  own sponsorship program, adding another 10,000 places for syrian refugees in the country   40   acutely vulnerable refugees include people who fall within the globally agreed resettlement criteria, such  as survivors of torture, refugees with serious medical conditions, or women left alone with several children  to care for and without family support (unhcr 2014c).
41   sweden and the united states resettled 468 and 136 syrians respectively (unhcr 2015i).


42   after seven years, foreign nationals are eligible to apply for permanent residence.
see german residence  act, section 26 (4).


267  the syrian refugee crisis(european resettlement network 2014).
sweden has also agreed to resettle more syrian  refugees; as of january 9, 2015, it had committed to 2,700 resettlement spots (unhcr  2015b).


43  the united states has not specified the number of syrian refugees it will admit.
44 however,  evidence suggests that it will resettle a larger number than the 105 syrians admitted in  fy 2014 over the next several years (us prm 2015).


in december 2014, the assistant  secretary for the us bureau of population, refugees, and migration (prm) announced that  the united states plans to take the lead in resettling syrian refugees worldwide (richard  2014).
she stated that the united states has been receiving roughly a thousand new unhcr  resettlement referrals from syria each month and that, at the beginning of december 2014,  it was in the process of reviewing 9,000 resettlement cases (ibid.


).
unhcr had submitted  10,201 syrian resettlement referrals to the united states, as of december 31, 2014 (unhcr  2015b).


prm anticipates that us resettlement of syrian refugees will dramatically increase  in 2015 and beyond (richard 2014; us prm 2014, 55).
45  like  the  united  states,  the  united  kingdom  has  not  committed  to  a  specific  number  of resettlement places.


instead, it introduced a vulnerable persons relocation scheme in  january  2014  for  particularly  vulnerable  syrians  (uk  home  office  2014a).
syrians  admitted through this program will be granted humanitarian protection status, which is an  immigration status given to individuals who need protection but do not meet the refugee  criteria defined in the 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees and the 1967  protocol  (european  database  of  asylum  law  2015).


46  humanitarian  protection  status  allows temporary residency for five years.
following this period, individuals may apply for  permanent settlement, known as indefinite leave to remain (uk home office 2013; uk  home office 2014a).


by the end of cy 2014, the uk had granted humanitarian protection  to 143 syrian refugees under this system (uk home office 2014b).
though the uk home  office has not provided a quota for this program, it has indicated that it anticipates helping  around several hundred syrians over a three-year period (bardens, gower, and smith 2014,  3).


at this rate, resettlement is unlikely to offer a substantial solution to the overburdened  states hosting syrian refugees or to the massive number of vulnerable syrians living in  them.
out of the four countries, germany and the united states have provided the most  resettlement places.


as of january 9, 2015, these two countries made up one-half of all the  resettlement and other forms of admission space offered for syrian refugees by countries  outside the region.
47 nevertheless, the roughly 40,201 places offered by germany and the   43   resettled refugees in sweden receive a permanent residence permit (government of sweden 2014, 7)  44   resettled refugees in the united states must apply to adjust to permanent residence status one year after  their admission (government of us 2014, 8) 45   for example, the prms report on proposed refugee admissions for 2015 said the united states will  welcome syrians approved for resettlement in larger numbers in 2015 (us prm 2014).


it also stated that  it anticipates the launch of significant processing of syrians during fy 2015 (ibid.
).


from the start of fy  2015 through april 20, 2015, 651 syrians were resettled to the united states (us prm 2015).
46   humanitarian protection status is the united kingdoms equivalent to subsidiary protection which is  defined in eu directive 2011/95/eu, article 2(g) (european database of asylum law 2015).


47   according to unhcr, states have pledged a total of 79,180 places for resettlement and other forms of  humanitarian admission for syrian refugees, as of january 9, 2015 (unhcr 2015b).

7 million registered refugees residing in jordan,  lebanon, egypt, iraq, and turkey.
syrian asylum seekers and refugees   another avenue available for syrians wishing to find refuge in states outside the region is  to seek protection through asylum, a method syrians have used at an increasing rate since  2012.


the protracted nature of the conflict, the grim situation for refugees in neighboring  countries,  and  the  relatively  small  number  of  resettlement  slots  could  be  contributing  factors to the rise in syrian asylum claims made outside the region.
since 2012, germany,  sweden, the united kingdom, and the united states have all seen a significant growth in  both the number of syrian asylum applications received and the number of syrians granted  asylum.


germany  and  sweden,  by  far,  received  the  greatest  number  of  asylum  applications  by  syrian nationals out of the four states over a three-year period starting in 2012 (see table  1).
between 2012 and 2014, germany received 61,885 syrian asylum claims and sweden  received  55,210  (ibid.


).
in  relation  to  germany  and  sweden,  the  number  of  syrians  requesting asylum in the united kingdom and the united states was modest.


between  2012 and 2014, 5,739 syrians sought asylum in the united kingdom (ibid.
).


the united  states received the fewest requests over a three-year period, with an estimated 5,280 claims  submitted by syrians from fy 2012 through 2014 (ibid.
).


all four states saw a substantial rise in the number of applications submitted since 2012.
germany received 41,100 syrian asylum applications in 2014 alone, over three-fold the  number filed in 2013 (12,855), and five times the number received in 2012 (7,930) (see  table 1).


in sweden, 30,750 syrian asylum claims were made in 2014 (ibid.
).


this was  a significant rise from the 16,540 claims submitted in 2013 and the 7,920 made in 2012  (ibid.
).


in the united states, the number of syrian asylum applications nearly tripled between fy  2012 and fy 2014, reflecting the same general trend experienced in germany and sweden.
in fy 2012, 839 asylum applications were filed by syrian nationals in the united states  (uscis 2014a; eoir 2014).


48 this number rose to 2,074 in fy 2013 and to around 2,367  in fy 2014 (ibid.
).


49 the united kingdom also saw a rise in the number of syrian asylum  applications, receiving 1,289 in 2012 and 2,410 in 2014 (see table 1).
following the trend of asylum applications, all four states have increased grants of asylum  to syrians since 2012, although there was considerable variance in asylum grants to syrians  by state.


overall, germany granted asylum to the largest number of syrians (39,965) from  2012 through 2014, followed closely by sweden (31,771) (see table 1).
in contrast, the  united  kingdom  granted  asylum  to  only  3,548  syrians  during  this  period  (ibid.


).

269  the syrian refugee crisisunited states provided asylum to the fewest number of syrians over a three-year period.
from fy 2012 through fy 2014, the united states granted asylum to an estimated 1,986  syrians (ibid.


).
though the united states granted asylum to the fewest syrians out of the four states, it  increased asylum grants to syrians between fy 2012 and 2013.


in fy 2013, 811 syrians  were  granted  asylum  in  the  united  states,  more  than  double  the  364  syrians  granted  asylum in fy 2012 (martin and yankay 2014).
the data for the number of asylum grants  in fy 2014 was not published by the us department of homeland securitys office of  immigration statistics at the time this paper was written.


however, based on the number  of asylum applications submitted in fy 2014, it is estimated that the number of syrians  granted asylum in fy 2014 will be comparable to the number granted in fy 2013.

temporary protection   temporary  protection  is  another  possible  means  for  providing  protection  to  syrians.
temporary protection provides beneficiaries with the legal right to be in a country, for a  limited time, due to risk of serious harm in a persons home country (miller and orchard  2014).


50 at the end of 2014, temporary protection was available for syrians in the united  states but was not available at a regional level in europe (uscis 2015; miller and orchard  2014).
51 in the united states, temporary protected status (tps) allows individuals from a designated  country  to  remain  and  to  work  for  fixed,  renewable  periods.


52  tps  can  be  granted  to   50   eu directive 2001/55/ec, article 2(a); us ina, section 244(b)(1) 51   germany and the united kingdom technically grant temporary protection for syrians admitted through  their resettlement programs.
however, this is not discussed in this section because it was covered in the  resettlement portion of the paper.


52    to  qualify  for  temporary  protected  status  the  non-citizen  must  demonstrate  that  he  or  she  has  been  continuously present in the united states since the effective date of the most recent designation of his or her  country of origin for temporary protected status.
see us ina, section 244(c).


270  journal on migration and human securitynationals of the designated state (or individuals without nationality who habitually resided  in the designated country) in which there is an armed conflict, a natural disaster, or other  extraordinary and temporary conditions that prevent them from returning.
53 in 2014, 11  countries were designated for temporary protected status by the united states: el salvador,  guinea, haiti, honduras, liberia, nicaragua, sierra leone, somalia, sudan, south sudan,  and syria (ester, seghetti, and wasem 2015).


syria has been one of the designated countries  since  march  29,  2012  (uscis  2015).
54  by  january  2015,  approximately 5,000  syrians  had been granted tps, and an estimated additional 5,000 individuals were eligible to file  applications for this status (uscis 2015, 248).


in the eu, temporary protection generally refers to a procedure to provide, in the event  of a mass influx or imminent mass influx of displaced persons from third countries who  are unable to return to their country of origin, immediate and temporary protection to such  persons.
55 it applies not only to persons already in europe, but unlike tps allows for the  entry of displaced persons.


56 the eu has had a regional temporary protection mechanism  since 2001.
57 one rationale behind the eus development of this regional mechanism was  to promote solidarity and burden-sharing among eu states with respect to receiving large  numbers of potential refugees at one time (ibid.


).
at the end of 2014, the eu had neither  designated  temporary  protection  for  nationals  from  syria  nor  activated  the  temporary  protection mechanism for the nationals of any country since it was included in eu legislation  in 2001 (chatty and orchard 2014; miller and orchard 2014).


appraisal of refugee protection in germany, sweden, the united   kingdom, and united states to varying degrees, all four countries saw a progressive increase in the number of syrians  provided protection through asylum and resettlement (and tps in the united states) since  2012.
by the end of 2014, germany had provided protection to the largest number of syrians  (approximately 67,000) out of the four countries, leading in both resettlement places and   53   us ina, section 244(b)(1) 54   on march 29, 2012, the us secretary of homeland security designated syria for temporary protected  status based on extraordinary and temporary conditions within the country that prevented syrian nationals,  and those with no nationality who last habitually resided in syria, from returning to it in safety (uscis 2015,  246).


on january 5, 2015, the us department of homeland security announced an 18-month extension of  the temporary protected status designation for syria.
the extension is effective from april 1, 2015 through  september 30, 2016 (uscis 2015).


55   eu directive 2001/55/ec, article 2(a).
the duration of temporary protection shall be one year.


it may be  extended automatically by two six-month periods for a maximum of one year (eu directive 2001/55/ec,  article 4(1)).
where reasons for temporary protection persist, the council of the european union may decide  to extend that temporary protection up to one more year (ibid.


, article 4[2]).
according to the eu directive,  temporary  protection  should  not  displace  asylum,  but  should  be  an  intermediary,  immediate  measure  of  protection, and persons granted temporary protection should be able to apply for and be granted refugee or  subsidiary status if eligible (ibid.


paragraph 10 and article 19).
56   see eu directive 2001/55/ec, article 2(d), temporary protection can apply to a spontaneous movement  of a large number of people from a particular country or region or an assisted evacuation into europe; and  article 8(3), which says states should facilitate the entry of eligible persons into their territory.


57   eu directive 2001/55/ec   271  the syrian refugee crisisindividuals  granted  asylum.
58  sweden  came  in  second  (approximately  34,500  syrians),  due largely to the high number of syrians given asylum.


although the united states has  indicated it will resettle more syrian refugees compared to sweden (and it also offers tps),  it has granted asylum to relatively few, placing it third in the level of protection provided  (approximately 17,000 syrians).
out of the four countries, the united kingdom provided  protection to the smallest number of syrians (approx.


3,700) by the end of 2014.
the reasons for the difference in raw numbers among these states is complicated and difficult  to determine.


a range of factors could account for the variance, including political policies  and objectives, refugee friendly reputations among asylum seekers, family ties, ease of  access  and  location,  and  procedural  constraints.
sweden,  for  instance,  has  a  reputation  among syrian asylum seekers for being a safe haven, which could be a contributing  factor in the high number of syrian asylum seekers, and consequently the large number of  syrians granted asylum (brennen 2013; rothschild 2014).


59 on the other hand, the united  states is geographically much further from syria than its european counterparts, which  may be one reason for the small number of individuals seeking asylum there.
at the same time, the united states has a policy that aims to take at least 50 percent of all  refugees referred for resettlement by unhcr worldwide, and indicates that it will resettle  more syrian refugees in the near future (us prm 2014).


in contrast, the british government  does not appear to be inclined to offer a large number of resettlement slots.
this could be  due to its current policy objectives.


the british government, under the leadership of prime  minister david cameron, has vowed to reduce net migration numbers, and resettling a  large number of syrian refugees could be perceived as contradictory to this goal (watt and  mason 2014).
gauging differences among these four states in terms of the number of syrians provided  protection  refuge  (i.


e.
,  through  resettlement,  asylum,  and  temporary  protection)  can  be  valuable in raising awareness about the degree of protection provided by each state relative  to the others.


it also sheds light on the level of burden sharing each state has contributed.
this information can be used to apply pressure on other states to do more to aid in the syrian  refugee crisis.


germany and sweden, for example, have provided notable protection space  for syrian refugees and represent positive models which can encourage other industrialized  states  throughout  europe,  north america,  and  the asia  pacific  region  to  increase  their  efforts.
likewise, the united states and the united kingdom stand as models in relation  to the amount of single-state humanitarian aid provided to syria and the regional countries  hosting syrian refugees.


nonetheless, the responses of germany, sweden, the united kingdom and the united states  are modest in relation to the contributions of neighboring countries to syria.
an estimated  125,000 syrians have received protection in the four states by the end of 2014 compared  to  the  3.


7  million  registered  syrian  refugees  in  the  region,  not  to  mention  the  syrians   58   estimates for the number of syrians provided protection in each of the four states are based on the number  of syrians granted asylum and the number of resettlement places offered by the end of 2014.
in the united  states, the number of syrians provided temporary protected status is also included.


59   on september 3, 2013, the swedish migration board revised its policy on syrian asylum applicants to  ensure that syrians given subsidiary protection status were awarded permanent residence permits instead of  temporary residence permits (miller and orchard 2014, 40).

the relatively small numbers offered  protection by these four states is of even greater concern given that germany and sweden  have admitted the largest number of syrians aside from countries in the region.
this paints  a bleak picture for the level of protection provided to syrian refugees by industrialized  states outside the region.


conclusion and recommendations  in  general,  industrialized  countries  outside  the  region  have  not  contributed  sufficiently  toward  alleviating  the  burden  caused  by  the  syrian  refugee  influx.
even  though  there  are  important  variances  between  industrialized  states,  and  some  states  have  provided  commendable support, neighboring countries still shoulder the vast majority of the burden  in  terms  of  both  financial  impact  and  accommodation  of  the  refugee  population.


it  is  difficult for syrian refugees to attain protection outside of egypt, iraq, jordan, lebanon, and  turkey.
the small number of refugee resettlement and other forms of admission available  leave asylum seeking as one of the only options for syrians pursuing protection beyond  the region.


traveling to a country of asylum can be extremely arduous and dangerous, and  relatively few syrians are able even to seek protection through asylum in europe and north  america due, in part, to the difficult journey, tightly controlled borders, and geographic  location (iom 2014).
the  observations  presented  in  this  paper  suggest  two  overarching  recommendations  to  mitigate the burden placed on neighboring countries and three specific recommendations to  facilitate syrian refugees access to protection in states outside the region.


the overarching  recommendations are: increase  burden  sharing  by  the  international  community  as  a  whole.
collectively,  the  international community has failed to meet the demands of the syrian refugee crisis.


to  alleviate the enormous strain placed on neighboring states, the international community  ought to contribute more in financial and resettlement assistance.
increase  distribution  of  the  burden  between  states.


there  is  significant  discrepancy  in  the level of burden sharing by industrialized states, and the level ought to be dispersed  more evenly.
countries like germany and sweden have provided a relatively high level  of protection to syrians while many others, such as the united kingdom, australia, japan,  saudi arabia, kuwait, and the united arab emirates, have not offered much.


likewise,  the  united  states  has  contributed  a  disproportionate  share  of  financial  support  among  industrialized states, and countries like france, spain, and russia have provided very little.
if more states contribute, the burden will be more manageable for all.


specific  measures  states  should  take  to  facilitate  syrian  refugees  access  to  protection  outside the region include:    increase refugee resettlement places for syrian refugees, especially those who are   acutely vulnerable.

allow syrians the possibility to apply for protection in developed states through   embassies in neighboring countries to syria.
