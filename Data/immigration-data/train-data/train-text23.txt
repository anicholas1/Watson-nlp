refugee, asylum, and related  legislation in the us congress:  20132016  tara magner1  executive summary members of congress have introduced numerous pieces of legislation in  recent years related to refugees, asylum seekers, and other populations of  migrants seeking protection in the united states.
these bills were drafted  in reaction to dramatic events within the united states, at its borders,  and  around  the  world.


for  example,  roughly  400,000  children  traveling  alone and mothers with children have arrived at the southern us border  since 2013, many seeking protection from organized crime, gang violence,  and threats of human trafficking.
similarly, more than a million refugees  from the middle east, north africa, and asia sought to reach safety on  the european continent in 2015 alone.


terrorist attacks fueled attempts to  curtail the us commitment to offer protection to those fleeing persecution,  even when those attacks had no connection to refugees or only tenuous  links.
and yet existing us law has been left virtually unchanged throughout  this tumultuous period.


this article describes the significant attempts to  enact legislation related to refugees and international migrants since 2013  and examines the reasons why those attempts have not succeeded.
it also  describes american attitudes toward refugees and assesses whether those  attitudes affected the fate of legislation.


i.
introduction this paper documents and explores a conundrum: in an era of unprecedented and rising  levels  of  forced  migration,  the  politicization  of  humanitarian  protection,  and  pervasive  security concerns, us laws related to refugees, asylum seekers, and other forced migrants  have remained largely unchanged.


2    since 2013, members of congress have introduced numerous bills related to refugees and  other forced migrants, often in reaction to dramatic events within the united states, at its  borders,  and  around  the  world.
for  example,  roughly  400,000  children  traveling  alone  and  mothers  with  children,  have  arrived  at  the  southern  us  border  since  2013,  most   1   director, chicago commitment, the john d.

113th congress: 20132014  a.


comprehensive immigration reform   on june 27, 2013, the us senate passed the border security, economic opportunity, and  immigration  modernization act  of  2013,  commonly  referred  to  by  its  senate  number,  s.
744.


3 the bill attempted to comprehensively reform the nations immigration laws.
it  was the third time in under a decade that congress attempted to enact such a broad revision  of the immigration laws.


the senate vote was 68 yeas to 32 nays, with 14 republicans  joining 54 democrats to support the bill.
however, the house of representatives declined  to debate the bill during the 113th congress (2013-2014), and it expired along with all  other pending legislation at the end of 2014.


neither chamber of congress attempted to  pass substantial reform of the immigration system in the 114th congress (2015-2016).
most of the media coverage of s.


744 addressed the senates vigorous debates over a few  key elements of the sprawling bill, including border security, the allocation of visas for  lawful  permanent  residents  (green  cards),  and  a  program  to  regularize  the  status  of  unauthorized immigrants.
the public and the media paid scant attention to measures that  would have vastly expanded protections for refugees, asylum seekers, and other populations  seeking humanitarian protection in the united states.


in fact, s.
744 contained nearly two- dozen sections that, if enacted, would have facilitated the entry of refugees selected for  resettlement in the united states, eased the burdens on asylum seekers arriving at ports  of entry, and provided enhanced protections to children fleeing persecution or trafficking.


the majority of these sections were included in the original version of the bill, a package  developed by the so-called gang of eight, which was composed of four republican and  four democratic senators.
4 other humanitarian provisions were added to the bill during the  executive business meetings (commonly called markups) of the senate committee on  the judiciary, where four of the eight gang members served.


while slight modifications  were made to a few humanitarian sections in the committee markup, none were significantly   3   border security, economic opportunity, and immigration modernization act of 2013, s.

167  refugee, asylum, and related legislation in the us congressaltered.


a few of these sections survived attempts to strike them from the bill.
the judiciary  committee voted to report s.


744, as amended, favorably to the full senate on may 21,  2013 by a vote of 13 yeas to 5 nays, with three republicans voting in favor.
5  ironically, the senate consideration of s.


744 came close on the heels of the april 15, 2013  bombing at the finish line of the boston marathon.
in the days following the bombing,  initial reports suggested that the then-alleged attackers, tamerlan and dzhokhar tsarnaev,  were originally admitted to the united states as refugees, suggesting a failure of security  screening.


in fact, the tsarnaev brothers were the sons of an asylee from russia, an ethnic  chechen.
nonetheless, refugee and asylee advocates feared that inaccurate information  and  suspicions  about  the  suspects  would  jeopardize  the  humanitarian  provisions  in  the  original bill.


in retrospect, it is remarkable that the refugee and other humanitarian provisions not only  survived senate deliberations, but that additional protective measures were added to the  bill during the committee markup.
senate bill 744 was introduced on april 17, 2013, two  days after the boston bombing.


the first judiciary committee hearing on s.
744 took place  just two days later, april 19, in the midst of intense dispatches from boston.


the committee  convened just hours after one bombing suspect, tamerlan tsarnaev, died from gunshot  wounds sustained during a shootout with police officers, and while an intense manhunt  ensued for the surviving suspect, dzhokhar tsarnaev.
the judiciary committee began to hold hearings on the bill in may 2016, meeting several  times  that  month  to  debate  amendments  to  the  legislation.


the  boston  bombing  was  referenced several times, and the committee voted to add a few amendments related to  national security, but the bills momentum was not diminished by the attacks.
while s.


744 was never enacted, its passage by the full senate represents the closest that  congress has come to significantly modifying the nations refugee and asylum laws in  more  than  a  decade.
refugee-related  bills  introduced  in  the  intervening  years,  such  as  the refugee protection act,6 were considered in committee hearings, but did not receive  committee votes or floor debate in either chamber of congress.

refugee and humanitarian provisions in s.


744   the bipartisan senate legislation, s.
744, contained 23 sections related to refugees, asylum  seekers,  unaccompanied  immigrant  children,  and  other  populations  of  international  migrants.


this number was extraordinary by comparison to the two prior attempts in recent  history to enact comprehensive immigration reform legislation in the senate, in 20067 and  2007,8 both of which bills contained few refugee and asylum provisions.

9  with s.


744, most of the refugee and humanitarian sections were included in the introduced  version of the bill.
as noted above, most sections remained intact through the committee  markup,  and  some  additional  humanitarian  measures  were  added  in  those  meetings.


where  senators  offered  amendments  in  the  committee  markup  to  sharply  curtail  or  to  strike protections, the amendments failed.
a few amendments added during the markup  essentially  restated  current  law  or  policy    for  example,  by  codifying  the  existing  background checks applied to refugee applicants10 and by strengthening the authority of  the secretary of homeland security to terminate refugee or asylum status if the recipient of  such status returns to their country of origin without good cause.


11  why was s.
744 such a strong humanitarian bill?


a few factors contributed to this outcome.
first, the gang of eight included some senators who had strong records on refugee and  humanitarian  protection.


some  favored  refugee  protection  in  general,  such  as  richard  durbin  (d-il)  and  robert  menendez  (d-nj).
others,  such  as  john  mccain  (r-az),  supported certain populations who were targeted for persecution, including afghans and  iraqis who experienced threats in their home countries after working for the us military or  aid organizations.


as the eight senators prepared the base bill for introduction, they drew  a number of sections from existing legislation, such as the refugee protection act, and  included them in the package.
12 while the gang of eight did not comment on its internal  deliberations as it drafted the package, it chose to defend the base bill throughout senate  consideration.


with four of the eight senators serving on the judiciary committee,13 and  typically voting as a bloc on amendments, the bill emerged with few modifications to the  humanitarian sections.
specifically,  s.


744es  (the  version  that  passed  in  the  senate)  contained  sections  that  addressed the following:  a.
special immigrant visas for iraqis and afghans  congress created this category of visa in 2006 to provide lawful permanent residence in  the united states to iraqis and afghans who assisted the us government in its missions in  those nations.


senate bill 744 expanded the availability of the visas, imposed measures to  ensure timely processing of applications, and provided a review process for those whose   9   illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996, division c of pub.

b.


protections for asylum seekers  with limited exceptions, current law requires an asylum seeker to file an application for  asylum within one year of arriving on us soil.
the senate bill repealed the filing deadline  that  is  imposed  on  asylum  seekers  in  the  united  states.


16  it  also  proposed  to  move  all  initial adjudications of asylum applications to a non-adversarial interview process at us  citizenship  and  immigration  services  (uscis)  asylum  office,  rather  than  requiring  certain applications to be adjudicated as a defense to deportation in the immigration courts.
17  finally, in a section added to the bill during markup, s.


744 clarified that an applicant for  asylum would be granted a work permit 180 days after the asylum application was filed.
18  currently, the issuance of a work permit can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including  the long adjudication backlogs for both affirmative and defensive asylum applications.


as a  result, many asylum seekers struggle to support themselves and their families as they await  a decision on their asylum application.
c.


protections for refugees  the senate bill contained a number of measures designed to improve access to protection  in the united states for refugees selected overseas.
it would have conferred authority on  the president to designate certain populations as refugees, enabling the secretary of state  to establish efficient processes for adjudicating their claims.


19 this measure was modeled  on existing authority, commonly referred to as the lautenberg amendment, which offers  a  similarly  streamlined  refugee  status  determination  process  for  religious  minorities,  and  certain  other  persecuted  groups,  from  designated  nations.
20  the  senate  bill  also  included sections to expand admission for refugee children, and children of children, who  accompanied a family member to the united states;21 it would have allowed refugees to   14   s.

this provision was cited periodically in debates among the republican  presidential candidates, as senator ted cruz (r-tx) claimed that it would weaken security screening of  refugees.
in fact, all potential refugees selected through this program would be subject to the same security  and background checks as required for traditional refugee processing.


senator cruz implied that senator  rubios support for the bill signified a weakness on national security, yet the section was part of the base bill,  which received a bipartisan vote in the judiciary committee, and 68 votes in favor when considered by the  full senate.

24 finally, as a result of an amendment offered by senator graham of  south carolina, a member of the gang of eight, the bill would have authorized dhs to  terminate  the  asylee  or  refugee  status  of  a  person  who  returned  to  their  home  country  without good cause prior to adjusting to lawful permanent resident status in the united  states.

the applicant would have also been required to pass  national security and background checks.

171  refugee, asylum, and related legislation in the us congress18 from non-contiguous countries (meaning all nations but canada and mexico) who  arrive at a us border or other point of entry unaccompanied by a parent or guardian.


a  section was added to s.
744 to pilot the use of child welfare professionals in assisting  us customs and border protection (cbp) to screen unaccompanied minors arriving at  the us border for human trafficking or other abuses.


the amendment was modified to  require live training for cbp officials who might come into contact with unaccompanied  immigrant children.
30  for unaccompanied immigrant children apprehended in the united states, a section added  to the bill would require a number of steps to be taken by dhs and the department of  health and human services (dhhs) to enhance protections for the children.


with regard  to children who did not win a claim for humanitarian protection, it would establish a  program to develop best practices for their safe repatriation.
31  the senate bill included a provision clarifying that the attorney general has authority  to appoint legal representation for unaccompanied immigrant children and those with  serious mental disabilities in certain deportation proceedings to help ensure that such  proceedings are expeditious and cost-effective.


32 an amendment to that section required  dhs to provide a non-citizen who is subject to deportation with a complete copy of his  or her alien file (a-file) before commencing removal (deportation) proceedings.
33  a section added to the bill during committee markup would transfer the administration of  the unaccompanied alien children legal services program from dhhs to the department  of justices (doj) executive office for immigration review.

744 but defeated in committee markup during  the  judiciary  committee  markup,  senator  charles  grassley  (r-ia)  offered  amendments to strike provisions of the bill designed to facilitate the process of applying  for asylum in the united states.
specifically, one amendment would have (1) struck the  full repeal of the one-year filing deadline for asylum applications and replaced it with a  filing deadline of 2.


5 years, and (2) struck language allowing all asylum seekers to initiate  their claims through a non-adversarial process.
39 the grassley amendment was defeated  by a vote of 6 yeas to 12 nays.


40 the four members of the gang of eight who served  on the judiciary committee voted against the amendment, apparently as a result of their  agreement to jointly defend the base bill.
senator grassley also offered an amendment to require the director of national intelligence  (dni) to submit to congress a report on the investigation into the boston marathon.


the  amendment would have imposed a delay on the implementation of the sections described  above (the full repeal of the one-year filing deadline, and the use of the non-adversarial  process)  for  one  year  after  the  date  that  the  dni  submitted  the  report.
41  the  grassley  amendment was defeated by a voice vote on may 20, 2013.

744  in  june  2013.
due  to  procedural  disagreements  between the majority and minority parties, very few amendments were considered and  voted upon.


as a result, the full senate did not vote on any amendments related to refugee  or humanitarian provisions.
on june 19 and june 20, 2013, senator mary landrieu (d-la) discussed an amendment  she hoped to offer to s.

the amendment  would have required federal agencies and immigration courts to consider the best interests  of  the  child  in  all  proceedings  and  decisions  concerning  their  immigration  cases  and  potential repatriation.

45 senator landrieu was not able to offer the amendment due to  the procedural posture of the bill at that time, which would have required the unanimous  consent of all senators for amendments to be offered and voted upon.


senators eventually  agreed to vote on a so-called border surge amendment offered by senators bob corker  (r-tn) and john hoeven (r-nd) but senator landrieus amendment was not included in  it.

2014: unaccompanied immigrant children and families with   children for  the  decade  leading  up  to  2011,  the  number  of  unaccompanied  immigrant  children  (described above) arriving at us points of entry held steady between 6,000 and 8,000 per  year.


starting in 2011, the number of children fleeing el salvador, guatemala, and honduras  (the northern triangle countries of central america) increased dramatically and continued  rising, reaching a peak of 68,000 children in 2014.
the number of mothers with children  arriving from central america rose at similar levels, with an additional 68,000 individuals  arriving at the us-mexico border in 2014.


in 2014, an additional 29,000 individuals applied  for asylum in other central american nations, such as costa rica, nicaragua, and panama,  demonstrating that this population was not solely seeking protection in the united states  (unhcr  2016b).

legislation in the us congress related to child migrants proliferated in response to the  arriving children and families.


in the summer of 2014, as the number of unaccompanied  immigrant children and families with children arriving at the us-mexico border sharply  increased,  the  obama  administration  requested  emergency  appropriations  for  border  control, and for the detention and removal of the arriving migrants, most of whom sought  asylum or other forms of humanitarian protection.
in a letter to congress dated june 30, 2014, president obama sought additional authority  to  exercise  discretion  in  processing  the  return  and  removal  of  unaccompanied  minor  children.


49  current  law  provides  special  screening  for  unaccompanied  children  from  countries not contiguous to the united states in order to detect trafficking and other threats  of harm.
50 as a result, a child deemed to be unaccompanied is transferred to a federal  agency, the office of refugee resettlement, which provides care and custody, and seeks to  reunify the child with a parent or responsible guardian in the united states.


unaccompanied  immigrant  children  are  typically  placed  in  removal  proceedings,  but  are  not  subject  to  the expedited removal processes that adults face when apprehended at the border without  permission  to  enter  the  united  states.
unaccompanied  immigrant  children  may  pursue  humanitarian  relief  in  the  united  states,  such  as  asylum,  visas  for  crime  or  trafficking  visas, or a special immigrant juvenile visa created for abused, abandoned, or neglected  immigrant children.


when president obama sent a request to congress on july 8, 2014, he asked for $3.
7 billion  in emergency appropriations, and noted that he would separately request legal authority to  exercise discretion in processing the return and removal of unaccompanied minor children  from non-contiguous countries like guatemala, honduras, and el salvador.


51 refugee and  child advocates interpreted this to mean that the president would ask congress to modify  current  law  so  that  unaccompanied  immigrant  children  from  non-contiguous  countries  would no longer be provided special screening and heightened protections, but would be  quickly returned to their country of origin.
the response from congress was mixed.


most democrats rallied to preserve the protections  in current law.
for the most part, republicans supported the proposed increase to border  security, but expressed skepticism about the presidents desire to seek broader authority to  expeditiously remove the children.

175  refugee, asylum, and related legislation in the us congressby mid-july 2014, members in both chambers of congress introduced bills to curb the  protections available to children arriving in the united states alone.
52 policymakers and  advocates who favored current law rallied in opposition to any modification related to the  children, arguing that a large percentage of the arriving population would win protection  in the united states if they had a full and fair opportunity to pursue a claim.


in the end,  president obama did not make a specific request to congress to change the laws applying  to unaccompanied immigrant children; rather, he reversed his position and opposed bills  that threatened to do so.
after bickering within and between both parties and chambers of congress throughout  july  2014,  the  house  considered  an  appropriations  bill  that  would  have  curtailed  the  protections  in  current  law  for  unaccompanied  minors.


the  bill,  h.
r.


5230,  struck  the  special screening process for those children from non-contiguous countries and replaced  it  with  an  expedited  process  for  holding  hearings  on  the  childrens  immigration  cases.
the bill required immigration hearings to be held within seven days of the child being  apprehended and deemed unaccompanied.


humanitarian protection advocates in congress  and the nonprofit sector criticized the expedited process as insufficient time for a child to  understand how to navigate the immigration system, much less obtain legal counsel and  prepare a case seeking humanitarian protection.
53 the white  house  threatened  to  veto  the bill.


54 its statement of administration position declared, this bill will undercut due  process for vulnerable children which could result in their removal to life threatening  situations in foreign countries.
55  the house voted to pass h.


r.
5230 on august 1, 2014, with a vote of 223 to 189.


the  political parties largely held their own members, with only one democrat voting in favor  of the bill, and four republicans voting against it.
56 the senate did not debate that bill,  and no significant changes to refugee or humanitarian law were subsequently enacted in  2014.


however, while not modifying substantive law, congress appropriated funds in  a spending bill for fy 2015 directing the secretary of state to address the key factors  in  the  countries  in  central america  contributing  to  the  migration  of  unaccompanied,  undocumented minors to the united states.

176  journal on migration and human securitythe number of unaccompanied children and members of families with children who arrived  at the southern border and turned themselves in to or were apprehended by border patrol  dipped in 2015 to approximately 40,000 in each category (cbp 2015), but climbed again in  2016, with 59,692 children arriving at the southern us border in fy 2016 (cbp 2016).


the  number of individuals in families arriving at the southern border in fy 2016 was 77,674  (ibid.
).


the flows from the northern triangle of central america toward the united states have  not diminished.
with financial support from the us government, mexico stepped up the  border security efforts along its southern border, significantly increasing its apprehension  and deportation rates of central americans from approximately 80,000 in 2013 to 165,000  in 2015 (isacson 2016).


as a result, tens of thousands of individuals fleeing persecution and  violence in the northern triangle nations did not reach the us border.
meanwhile, over a million would-be refugees reached europe in 2015, mostly by taking  treacherous  sea  routes  across  the  mediterranean  and  aegean  seas  (unhcr  2016a).


over 300,000 arrived on european shores in the first nine months of 2016 (ibid.
).


these  international factors continued to influence legislation in the united states.

legislation designed to curtail humanitarian protections   following  the  failed  attempts  to  modify  current  law  in  the  113th  congress,  several  amendments and bills were introduced in the first session of the 114th congress to limit  the protections and due process afforded to children arriving alone from non-contiguous  nations.
during  debate  over  the  budget  resolution  for  fy  2016,  senator  john  mccain  (r-az)  offered an amendment that, according to the senators office, would prevent another wave  of unaccompanied minors from crossing over the us-mexico border .

58  despite  the  opposition  of  many  in  congress  and  of  refugee  and  child  advocates,59  the  mccain amendment passed by a vote of 58-42.


however, as an amendment to the budget  resolution, it was non-binding and did not modify current law.
as  a  side  note,  the  original  version  of  the  mccain  amendment  also  called  for  the  establishment of us consulate offices in el salvador, guatemala, and honduras to process  childrens applications for refugee status,60 but that portion of the amendment was stripped  before a floor vote on march 26, 2015.

129, contained many of the same provisions, but has not yet been marked up by a  committee.
62  the bills address both unaccompanied minors and asylum seekers of all ages.


combined,  they would make the following changes to law:    modify the definition of an unaccompanied immigrant child, and exclude those   with a parent or extended family member in the united states.
63     require federal agencies to inquire into the immigration status of the parents or  guardians of unaccompanied minors in the united states, and report to immigration  authorities any parents with unauthorized status, likely creating a disincentive for  those parents to claim and care for their children.


64     require that all unaccompanied immigrant children who are not victims of a severe  form of trafficking, and who are not afraid to return to their country of origin, be  removed.
65     strike  the  special  process  for  screening,  care,  and  custody  of  unaccompanied   immigrant children who are from non-contiguous countries.

71 the bills would also strike an existing exemption for unaccompanied  immigrant children to the one-year filing deadline for asylum applications.
72  2.


credible fear interviews  for all asylum seekers, regardless of age, the bills would raise the standard for credible  fear interviews provided to those seeking protection at a port of entry.
after apprehension,  if a person expresses a fear of return to their home country, federal authorities conduct an  interview to determine if the person has a significant possibility, taking into account the  credibility of the statements made by the alien in support of his or her claim and such other  facts as are known to the officer, that the alien could establish eligibility for asylum.


73  the bills would raise the standard by adding and it is more probable than not that the  statements made by the alien in support of the aliens claim are true.
74   3.


withholding of removal  one bill would codify in the statute that changes made to the asylum law by the real id  act of 2005 also apply to the standard for withholding of removal.
the real id act  added the following italicized language to the requirements for asylum: an asylum seeker  must establish that race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or  political opinion was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant  (emphasis  added).


75  the  real  id act  did  not  add  similar  language  to  the  statute  for  withholding of removal,76 but the board of immigration appeals, which considers appeals  from the immigration courts, later relied upon principles of statutory interpretation to rule  that the one central reason language applies to claims for withholding of removal.
77 one  of the pending house bills would codify that decision by adding the following statement to  the statute governing withholding of removal: the burden of proof shall be on the alien to  establish that the aliens life or freedom would be threatened in that country, and that race,  religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion would be  at least one central reason for such threat.

under measures in the bills, those who applied  for and did not obtain refugee status would be barred from a grant of parole.
this section  appeared  to  be  aimed  at  president  obamas  central  american  minor  refugee/parole  program, which explicitly contemplates bringing children at risk of harm in el salvador,  guatemala, or honduras to the united states on grants of parole.


79 the bills would also  limit humanitarian grants of parole to those who face an immediate medical emergency or  the imminent death of a close family member.
it would redefine public benefit to mean  reasons deemed strictly in the public interest [and] only if the alien has assisted the united  states government in a matter, such as a criminal investigation, espionage, or other similar  law enforcement activity, and either the aliens presence in the united states is required by  the government or the aliens life would be threatened if the alien were not permitted to  come to the united states.

temporary protected status  temporary protected status (tps) is a special form of protection provided to nationals  of foreign countries who are present in the united states as of a specified date.


it can  be authorized when, due to a natural disaster or conflict, conditions in the home country  temporarily prevent the united states from safely returning the nationals (see, generally,  bergeron 2014).
the senate bill would suspend the authority of the secretary of homeland  security to designate or re-designate any nation for tps until january 20, 2017 (the final  day of the current presidents term of office).


it would also limit any future grants of tps  to an initial designation period and one 18-month re-designation.
finally, it would limit  eligibility of future grants of tps to those who had lawful immigration status in the united  states on the effective date of the most recent designation of that nation.

reasons for failure of legislation to advance  despite being reported favorably to the full house, neither of the bills described above  (h.

in the senate, bills  limiting  protections  for  unaccompanied  minors  and  asylum  seekers  did  not  receive  committee votes, much less floor consideration.
as described below, when a house bill  curtailing refugee protection was brought to the senate floor, it failed to pass a cloture with  a 60-vote threshold.


in  june  2015,  senator  jeff  sessions  (r-al)  filed  versions  of  the  two  house  bills  as  amendments to the national defense authorization act of 2016.
82 a month earlier, when  the house debated its version of the defense bill, controversy arose over provisions related  to the service of undocumented immigrants in the us military.

180  journal on migration and human securitymccain, chairman of the senate armed services committee, declared that immigration  amendments would crash the bill (marcos and matishak 2015).
in the end, when the  senate debated the defense bill, senator sessions was not given the opportunity to formally  offer or obtain votes on the amendments.


in december 2015, congress enacted the consolidated appropriations act, 2016, which  provided up to $750 million to implement a series of security, economic, and rule of law  programs in central america.
83 the act directed us federal agencies to prioritize assistance  to address the key factors in countries contributing to the migration of unaccompanied  undocumented minors to the united states.


84 the consolidated appropriations act also  provided funds to doj to hire 55 new immigration judges and associates staff teams to help  address the severe backlogs in the immigration courts.
85 again, congress did not enact any  significant substantive changes to refugee or humanitarian law.


there may be several contributing reasons for the failure of legislation to advance.
the  democratic leadership and members in each chamber with records of protecting refugees  were largely successful in holding their caucuses together in opposition to the bills.


in  addition, child and refugee protection advocates pressed the house and senate leadership  to refrain from advancing bills that would repeal safeguards for asylum seekers, refugees,  and unaccompanied immigrant children.
it may also be the case that in an election cycle,  the  republican  leadership  in  each  chamber  did  not  relish  a  vicious  political  fight  over  immigration  that  could  further  splinter  their  party.


republican  leaders  may  have  also  believed that floor votes on these bills could motivate latino voters to rally to the opposing  party in the november 2016 election.

legislation designed to expand humanitarian protections  1.
unaccompanied immigrant children  in 2016, members of congress introduced companion bills in the house and senate to  increase due process and access to counsel for unaccompanied minors.


called the fair day  in court for kids act, 88 democrats in the house and 27 democrats and one independent in  the senate co-sponsored the bill as of october 1, 2016.
86 as of this writing, no republicans  have  cosponsored  the  legislation.


the  bill  authorizes  the  attorney  general  to  appoint  legal  representation  at  government  expense  to  non-citizens  in  deportation  proceedings,  and  mandates  that  counsel  be  provided  to  unaccompanied  immigrant  children  facing  deportation.
it also establishes a pilot program whereby nongovernmental organizations  assist children and certain other migrants with case management services in an attempt to  ensure that those migrants appear for court hearings.


without bipartisan support in either  chamber, it is unlikely that the bill will receive a vote in the 114th congress, but child  advocates  believe  it  is  nonetheless  important  to  encourage  elected  officials  to  publicly   83   consolidated appropriations act, 2016, p.

having taken a position on issues in the bill, members may retain pro- humanitarian positions in the face of politically charged votes in the future.
in the summer of 2016, democratic representatives and senators introduced companion  bills called the secure the northern triangle act.


87 the legislation authorizes funding to  enhance security in central america, combat narcotics and human trafficking, and prosecute  those engaged in organized crime.
it expands the processing of refugee women, children,  and families in the region so that they might avoid the dangerous routes typically taken as  these populations flee from their countries of origin.


the bill also includes a version of the  fair day for kids in court act (described above) and a number of measures designed to  reduce backlogs in the immigration courts.

refugee protection act  a bill first introduced by senator patrick leahy (d-vt) in 107th congress, the refugee  protection act  of  2001,  originally  addressed  the  concern  that  summary  inspection  and  expedited removal processes at borders and other points of entry could result in asylees  being turned away or unnecessarily detained in the united states.
88 a major rewrite of  the bill in 201089 marked the 30th anniversary of the refugee act of 1980, the bill that  codified the 1951 refugee convention and the 1967 refugee protocol in us law.


the  refugee protection act of 2010 encompassed an array of provisions that senator leahy  believed would strengthen the us refugee and asylum programs, and bring the nation back  into alignment with the spirit and obligations of the 1951 refugee convention.
while the  broader version of the refugee protection act has been introduced in the senate and house  in each congress since the 111th congress, it has not received a vote in either chamber.


however, the 2013 version of the bill was the source of many of the refugee, asylee, and  humanitarian provisions that the gang of eight included in the original version of s.

93 it would also require dhs to grant work authorization  permits to applicants for u and t visas (the latter for trafficking victims) if their applications  for the visas have been pending for 180 days.

refugee resettlement  in  2015,  senator  debbie  stabenow  (d-mi)  and  representative  bill  pascrell  (d-nj)  introduced  companion  bills  called  the  domestic  refugee  resettlement  reform  and  modernization act of 2015.


97 the bills were similar to one introduced in prior congresses  by then-representative gary peters (d-mi) who was elected to the us senate in 2014, and  who cosponsored the senate bill.
the bills address several long-standing concerns among  resettlement advocates in the united states, such as: (1) the quality and relevance of data  collected by the federal office of refugee resettlement; (2) the timeliness of information  shared by the state department with resettlement organizations about incoming refugees  selected  for  resettlement  in  the  united  states;  and  (3)  data  collection  on  secondary  migration, which refers to movement by resettled refugees around the united states after  they are admitted.


to date, neither the house nor senate has considered the legislation  post-introduction.

reactions to events in europe  in 2015, over a million refugees and displaced persons reached europe from north africa  and the middle east by traversing land borders or crossing the mediterranean or aegean  seas.
the united states responded by saying it would increase the number of refugees it  resettles.


it set goals of 85,000 in 2016 and 100,000 in 2017, respectively, with 10,000 spots  per year reserved for syrians.
(in september 2016, the obama administration adjusted its  goal upward, now planning to resettle 110,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017).


in 2015, some  members of congress supported admitting even higher numbers of refugees, while others  questioned the ability of the us government to effectively screen incoming refugees for  national security concerns.
the refugee screening process is conducted by a number of  intelligence and law enforcement agencies and provides the most thorough vetting of any  incoming immigrants to the united states (kerwin 2016, 83, 112-17).


the screening, which  can take 18 to 24 months, led to a trickle of syrians entering the united states through the  first half of fiscal year 2016.
however, admissions increased through the summer of 2016,  reaching 12,587 syrians as of the end of the fiscal year on september 30, 2016 (rpc 2016).


the total number of refugees admitted to the united states in fiscal year 2016 was 84,995,  effectively meeting the target goal of 85,000.
98 the refugee issue reached a fever pitch in response to the november 13, 2015 terrorist  attacks in paris, france, when the media reported that one of the perpetrators might have  used a syrian passport to enter europe.


authorities later stated that the passport was a  fake, but many in the united states equated the attackers with refugees from the middle  east (legum 2015).
it was later discovered that two of the paris attackers were iraqis who   95   id.

two other would-be attackers were stopped by suspicious border guards and did  not reach paris.
they eventually entered europe and were captured in salzburg, austria on  december 10, 2015 (faiola and mekhennet 2016).


by november 16, 2015, just three days after the paris attacks, 31 governors called for a  moratorium on admitting syrian refugees to the united states.
99 by november 17, 2015,  12 republican candidates for president called for a ban on syrian refugees entering the  united states; the remaining two candidates, jeb bush and ted cruz, suggested that they  would consider allowing christians from syria to be admitted as refugees (kaplan and  andrews  2015).


donald trump  declared  that,  as  president,  he  would  expel  any  syrian  refugee allowed into the country by the obama administration (ibid.
).


on november 17, 2015, representative michael mccaul (r-tx) introduced h.

4038,  the american security against foreign enemies act of 2015, or the american safe  act.
the bill would limit the admission any refugee from certain nations until federal  law enforcement and intelligence agencies had certified that the refugee was not a national  security threat.


the bill would apply to refugees from iraq and syria, or to refugees who  had been in iraq or syria after march 1, 2011.
two days after introduction, the bill passed the house of representatives by a vote of 289  to 137.


100 nearly four-dozen democrats joined all republicans in the house to vote in  favor of the bill.
in early january 2016, two iraqis who had been admitted to the united states as refugees  were arrested  one for allegedly providing material support to a terrorist organization  and the other for allegedly fighting alongside a terrorist organization overseas and then  lying about his activities to immigration authorities (doj 2016a, 2016b).


some governors  reiterated their calls for a moratorium on refugee admissions.
refugee advocates in congress and the nonprofit sector urged members of the senate to  oppose the american safe act, reminding policymakers that refugees already receive the  most intensive screening of any population for admission entering the united states.


the  advocates believed that by forcing officials to certify that each individual refugee was not a  threat, the bill would lead to diminished admissions overall and would discourage officials  from admitting any refugees from the named countries, effectively terminating protection  in the united states for persecuted iraqis and syrians.
on january 20, 2016, when the senate held a cloture vote to cut off debate and allow for a  vote on the american safe act, it did not meet the required 60-vote threshold.


the 55 to  43 vote tally was nearly party-line, with all republicans present voting in favor or cloture,   99   alabama and texas sued the federal government to block the entry of refugees selected for resettlement in  their states.
a federal judge dismissed the texas suit on june 15, 2016.


indianas governor issued an order to  block the resettlement of syrians in his state.
the order was blocked by a preliminary injunction, which was  upheld by the us court of appeals for the seventh circuit.


texas, kansas, and new jersey withdrew from  the federal resettlement program in 2016, but refugees may still be resettled in those states through privately  run programs operating in cooperation with the federal government.

iv.
role of public opinion  in  2015  and  2016,  a  number  of  research  institutions,  advocacy  organizations,  and  philanthropies conducted research into public opinion on attitudes toward refugees.


in a survey released in september 2015, prior to the attacks in paris that took place two  months later, the chicago council on global affairs found that in the united states, 63  percent of republicans viewed large numbers of immigrants and refugees coming into the  us as a critical threat while only 29 percent of democrats and 46 percent of independents  held that view (kafura and mcelmurry 2015).
the tent foundation commissioned research into public perceptions of the global refugee  crisis, conducting field interviews in november 2015 and january 2016 in 11 nations (tent  foundation 2016a).


102 it found that watershed moments had a profound impact on public  opinion in the 11 nations, whether generating sympathy or fear.
for example, the public  expressed a desire to assist refugees after seeing the photo of a three-year old boy, aylan al- kurdi, on a beach in turkey.


the child drowned trying to cross from turkey to greece with  his family.
on the other hand, when terrorist attacks are linked (accurately or inaccurately)  with refugees, the public responds with suspicion to refugees (ibid.


).
consistent with these mixed opinions, just over half of those surveyed in the 11 nations  believe that refugees are an economic burden on a receiving state, though the remainder  (42-43  percent)  said  they  believe  that  refugees  could  contribute  economically  (ibid.


).
an additional 6 to 7 percent believed that new arrivals from other nations benefitted the  receiving states economy (ibid.


).
eighty-six percent said they thought refugees could pose  a security risk, yet almost half believe that the risk can be controlled (ibid.


; tent foundation  2016b).
in the united states, the tent survey found public opinion to be mixed (tent foundation  2016b).


thirty-eight  percent  of  us  respondents  indicated  an  overtly  negative  attitude  toward refugees (ibid.
).


overall, the us averages were almost identical to the international  averages of 12 percent overtly positive attitudes toward refugees, 49 percent mixed views,  and 39 percent overtly negative (ibid.
).


sixty-six percent of the tent us survey respondents said they would accept a set quota of  refugees (54 percent) or any number the government determined to welcome (12 percent)  (ibid.
).


the combined 66 percent number is lower than the international average of 73  percent  of  respondents  saying  they  would  welcome  refugees  (tent  foundation  2016a,  note  123).
amnesty  international  released  polling  in  may  2016  finding  72  percent  of  americans responded yes to the question, would you personally accept people fleeing  war or persecution into your country?

).
a  brookings  institution  poll  released  in  june  2016  similarly  found  that  59  percent  of  americans support welcoming refugees from the middle east (telhami 2016).


when the  brookings poll asked americans what worried them most about resettlement from this  region, 46 percent expressed a concern over terrorism and 41 percent cited anxiety over  potential economic burden.
results from the tent survey found that 55 percent of americans  believe refugees (from any region, not specifically the middle east) pose no risk or that the  risk can be managed (tent foundation 2016b, note 127).


fifty-nine percent of americans  believe that refugees work hard to fit into their new communities (ibid.
).


a survey conducted by the chicago council on global affairs in june 2016, and released  in october 2016, asked questions based on party affiliation.
the chicago council found  that 56 percent of democrats in the united states support resettling syrian refugees, while  18 percent of republicans do (smeltz et al.


2016).
the survey also queried those who  described  themselves  as  core  supporters  of  republican  nominee  for  president,  donald  trump.


of those, only 9 percent support admitting syrian refugees in the united states  (ibid.
).


a  full  60  percent  of americans  responded  to  the  tent  survey  that  refugees  should  be  helped equally, regardless of their individual religious orientation (tent foundation 2016b,  note 127).
twelve percent favor giving preference to christians, a position held by some  politicians (ibid.


).
the brookings poll found that 38 percent of americans would support  a total shutdown of muslims entering the united states until our countrys representatives  can figure out what is going on, referring to the language that republican presidential  candidate donald trump used in december 2015 (telhami 2016, note 135).


the tent report summarized its findings this way: americans responded with empathy  to  the  clear  and  present  danger  in  which  refugees  find  themselves  and  many  want  to  help.
however,  saber-rattling  and  loose  talk  from  high  profile  politicians  and  media  commentators conflates victims of terrorism with the very perpetrators from whom they  flee (tent foundation 2016b, note 127).


that summation is consistent with the actions of  some legislators, state governors, and political candidates.
v.


conclusion  given recent events, it is somewhat remarkable that us refugee and humanitarian statutes  have remained largely unchanged.
the paris attacks in november 2015, the sharp increase  in arrivals of refugees at the southern border of the united states, and other events have all  contributed to a climate of fear, but this has not affected existing policy.


nonetheless, since the senate passage of s.
744 in the summer of 2013, those who favor  laws and policies that protect refugees, asylees, and other forced migrants have been on  the defensive.


legislators introduced bills to curb protections in us law, and in some cases  to  place  significant  impediments  in  the  path  of  refugees  from  middle  eastern  nations.
however, congress enacted virtually no changes to the law.


186  journal on migration and human securitymembers of congress who favor humanitarian protection opposed these bills and for the  most part maintained party unity when bills were scheduled for votes.
refugee and asylum  advocates coordinated with child protection supporters to recommend retention of current  law  where  the  statute  favors  humanitarian  relief.


occasionally,  republican  leadership  blocked members of its own party from offering amendments to bills in order to avoid  political  fights  over  broader  immigration  issues.
as  a  result,  congressional  leadership  advanced very few bills to committee or floor consideration.


the  political  dynamics  of  the  election  seasons  in  2014  and  2016  also  influenced  the  legislative process.
the leadership in both chambers of congress showed some reluctance  to  raise  immigration  issues  that  might  divide  the  majority  party.


moreover,  the  overall  gridlock in congress surely contributed to the lack of action on refugee or unaccompanied  immigrant  child  legislation.
as  a  result,  in  an  era  of  rising  forced  migration,  the  us  congress has retained the existing protections available to refugees and asylum seekers  despite a political climate defined by the politicization of migration.
