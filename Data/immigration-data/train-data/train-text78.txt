zero undocumented population  growth is here to stay and  immigration reform would  preserve and extend these gains  robert warren  center for migration studies  executive summary this  report  demonstrates  that  a  broad  and  sustained  reduction  in  undocumented immigration to the united states occurred in the 2008 to  2015 period.
first, the report shows that, contrary to conventional wisdom,  the great recession had little, if any, role in the transformation to zero  population growth.


the population stopped growing because of increased  scrutiny of air travel after 9/11, a decade and a half of accelerating efforts  to reduce illegal entries across the southern border, long-term increases in  the numbers leaving the population each year, and improved economic and  demographic conditions in mexico.
these conditions are likely to continue  for the foreseeable future.


it is time to recognize that the era of large-scale  undocumented population growth has ended, and that there is a need to  reform the us legal immigration system to preserve and extend these gains  (kerwin and warren 2017, 319-21).
major findings of the report include:   the  recession  did  not  reduce  arrivals  or  accelerate  departures  from  the undocumented population; it essentially had very little impact on  population change.


1    population growth was lower in 2008 to 2015 than in 2000 to 2008 for   all major sending areas and for 13 of the top 15 countries of origin.
2    population growth was lower in 2008 to 2015 than in 2000 to 2008 in  all of the top 15 states.


in 10 of the 15 top states, growth changed to  decline.
1   the term population in this paper refers to the undocumented population, both persons who have stayed  in the united states beyond the period of their temporary admission (overstays) and those who entered  without inspection (ewis).


2   in this paper, the terms 2000 to 2008 period and 2008 to 2015 period are not overlapping; they are  used for ease of presentation.
estimates for the two time periods are based on data for 2000, 2008, and 2015.


technically, the earlier period is for 2000 through 2007 (eight years), and the latter period is for 2008 through  2014 (seven years).

jmhs volume 5 number 2 (2017): 491-508  nearly twice as many left3 the undocumented population from mexico  than arrived in the 2008 to 2015 period  1.


7 million left the population  and 900,000 arrived.
almost  twice  as  many  overstays  as  persons  who  entered  without  inspection (ewis) arrived (joined the undocumented population) from  2008 to 2015  2.


0 million overstays compared to 1.
1 million ewis.


overstays  leave  the  undocumented  population  at  higher  rates  than  ewis: about 1.
9 million, or 40 percent, of overstays that lived in the  united states in 2008 had left the undocumented population by 2015,  compared to 1.


6 million, or 24 percent, of ewis.
the rate of overstays (65% of the newly undocumented), compared to  ewis, is more dramatic than the numbers indicate since estimates of  the undocumented count central american asylum seekers that cross  the us southern border as ewis.


introduction the cessation of undocumented population growth after 2008 and the historic decline in  arrivals from mexico have been well documented in reports by the center for migration  studies (cms) and the pew research center.
see, for example, warren and warren (2013),  warren  (2014),  gonzalez-barrera  (2015),  warren  and  kerwin  (2015a),  and  passel  and  cohn  (2016).


however,  much  of  that  information  has  been  about  total  population  size  or the population from mexico.
an important question has remained for policymakers:  is this just a pause in population growth, mostly involving mexico, or has the reduction  been widespread and is it likely to continue?


the size and breadth of the decline over the  past  decade,  reported  here,  indicates  that  fundamental  changes  have  occurred  that  will  prevent the resumption of population growth.
increased awareness of the extensive and  lasting reduction in undocumented population growth should enhance the prospects for  immigration reform.


the estimates presented here for 2008, and annually for 2010 to 2015, were derived by the  center for migration studies based on statistics on the foreign-born population collected  in the us census bureaus american community survey (acs), as described in detail in  warren (2014).
a summary of the estimation procedure is presented in the appendix.


the  estimates by country of origin for 2000 are consistent with estimates, by state, published in  international migration review (warren and warren 2013).
the first part of the paper challenges the contention that the recession stopped undocumented  population growth.


next, undocumented population growth in the 2008 to 2015 period  is  compared  to  growth  in  the  2000  to  2008  period.
the  focus  is  on  the  major  sending  countries and areas, and on the 15 most populous states.


then, trends in population change  within the 2008 to 2015 period are examined.
estimates of net arrivals and departures   3   undocumented residents can leave the population in four ways: emigrate voluntarily, adjust to lawful  status, be removed by the department of homeland security (dhs), or (a relatively small number) die.


492  journal on migration and human securityfrom the population for the 2008 to 2015 period are shown here for the first time.
finally,  new estimates of overstays and ewis in the 2008 to 2015 period are shown, along with  estimates of arrivals and departures from both categories of undocumented residents.


effects  of  the  recession  on  undocumented  population  change conventional  wisdom  holds  that  the  undocumented  population  stopped  growing  after  2008 because of the recession.
no demographic data have been presented to support this  assertion, and presumably none are needed because the two events occurred at about the  same time.


the corollary is that growth will resume along with economic recovery.
the  danger inherent in these erroneous beliefs is that much-needed immigration reform could  be delayed based on the assumption that renewed growth is inevitable.


the statistical evidence presented here shows that the recession had very little, if any, effect  on either undocumented arrivals or departures within the time frame of the recession.
the  data presented in the two graphs below are for mexico, but separate calculations for other  parts of the world produce the same conclusion.


figure 1 shows the trend in undocumented arrivals from mexico for each year from 2005  to 2011, well within the time period that arrivals would have been affected by the recession.
the trend line was derived based on the reported year of immigration of the undocumented  population from mexico in the 2013, 2014, and 2015 acs.

for this discussion, the important feature of figure 1 is that there was no significant drop in  arrivals at the time of the recession.
the sharp decline in arrivals from mexico continued at   493  zero undocumented population growth is here to staya steady pace from 2005 to 2011.


4 close examination of the trend line reveals a small dip in  2009, but further analysis showed that adding just 20,000 to the data point for 2009 creates  an almost perfectly straight line from 2006 to 2010.
as shown in figure 1, the recession had no significant impact on arrivals from mexico.


the  next question is whether the recession led to increased departures from the population.
if  so, there should be a noticeable downturn after 2008 in the size of population that was here  when the recession began.


figure 2 shows estimates of the undocumented population from  mexico that arrived before 2008 and lived in the united states in the 2010 to 2015 period.
cms derived the estimates shown in figure 2 based on annual acs data.

5 the trend line in figure 2 gives no  indication that the recession caused large numbers of undocumented residents to return to  mexico.
restricting the analysis to smaller entry cohorts, for example those who arrived in  2002 to 2007, produces the same pattern of gradual decline shown in figure 2.


4   it is important to note that the single-year data for figure 1 have not been smoothed statistically.
for each  year of entry, single-year data were derived from the 2013, 2014, and 2015 american community survey  (acs), and those estimates were averaged, within the same year of entry, to reduce the effects of sampling  variability.


for example, the estimate shown for 2011 is the average of estimated arrivals in 2011 based on  data from the 2013, 2014, and 2015 acs.
5   note that the population in figure 2 should only decline because it does not receive any new arrivals; by  definition, everyone in the population arrived before 2008.


494  journal on migration and human securitypopulation  growth  stopped  in  2008  because  trends  that  were  in  place  well  before  the  recession  continued.
these  included  enhanced  scrutiny  of  air  travel  after  9/11,  greatly  increased  and  generally  successful  efforts  to  reduce  illegal  entries  across  the  southern  border,  and  positive  economic  and  demographic  changes  in  mexico.


as  these  factors  were acting to reduce the inflow, the number leaving the population increased steadily as  a growing population generated higher levels of emigration, adjustments to lawful status,  and deportations.
6 the population stopped growing because these complex historical and  demographic trends converged in 2008.


the fact that population growth stopped at about  the same time that the recession began was merely a historical coincidence.
population change  2000 to 2008 compared to 2008 to  2015  estimates by country of origin  table 1 shows estimates of the undocumented population for world regions and the top  15 countries7 in 2000, 2008, and 2015.


columns 4 and 5 show average annual population  change for the 2000 to 2008 and 2008 to 2015 periods.
annual undocumented population  change  declined in  2008  to  2015,  compared  to  2000  to  2008,  for  every  major  sending  area and for 13 of the 15 top countries (table 1).


the only exceptions to the across-the- board declines were el salvador and china.
population change for these two countries is  discussed below.


overall, there was a large reduction in population change in the latter period; in many  cases, net growth became net decline.
the total population increased by nearly 360,000 in  2000 to 2008; it dropped by an average of 60,000 per year in 2008 to 2015.


annual growth  from mexico fell sharply, from a net gain of about 200,000 per year in 2000 to 2008 to a net  decline of more than 100,000 per year in 2008 to 2015 (table 1).
the us undocumented  populations from south america and europe changed from net gains in 2000 to 2008 to  net losses in 2008 to 2015.


estimates by state of residence  table 2 is similar to table 1 except that it shows estimates by state of residence instead of  country of origin.
annual population change was lower in all 15 top states in 2008 to 2015  than it was in 2000 to 2008 (table 2).


of the top 15 states,8 all had positive growth in 2000  to 2008.
in 2008 to 2015, the undocumented population declined in 10 of those 15 states,  with only texas, at 17,000, growing by more than 6,000 annually.


6   according  to warren  and warren  (2013),  the  number  leaving  the  undocumented  population  increased  gradually  from  about  180,000  in  1990  to  550,000  in  2008  (see table  3  in  that  report).
the  numbers  of  adjustments to lawful status and removals by dhs increased in 2001 to 2008 compared to earlier periods.

in this section, we examine population change within 2008 to 2015.


estimates of  two significant aspects of undocumented population change are shown here for the first  time.

from 2008 to 2015, about 3.


1 million arrived (joined the undocumented population)  and 3.
5 million left this population (table 3).


for mexico, nearly twice as many left  the population (1.
7 million) as arrived (900,000).


departures also exceeded arrivals  from south america and europe during the period.
for central america, asia, and  africa, arrivals were higher than departures, and thus the population from those areas  increased.


note, however that population growth was lower in 2008 to 2015 than it was  in 2000 to 2008 for all three of these areas.
2.


percentage of the 2008 population that had left the population by 2015.
in just seven years, nearly half of the population from the caribbean, south america,  europe, asia, africa, and oceania were no longer in the undocumented population (table  3).


the percentages for these six areas range from 42 to 58 percent.
the percentages for  mexico and central america are considerably lower, at 25 and 16 percent, respectively.


possible reasons for the relatively lower percentages for mexico and central america  are discussed in a later section.
arrivals and departures by area of origin   table 3 shows estimates of arrivals and departures for 2008 and 2015 for major sending  areas.


almost  as  many  undocumented  persons  arrived  from  asia  as  from  mexico    885,000 compared to 900,000.
however, departures from the undocumented population  from mexico exceeded those from asia by slightly more than one million (table 3).


the  higher number leaving the population from mexico reflects a much larger population at risk  of leaving, as evidenced by the lower percentage that left the undocumented population  from mexico compared to the population from asia (table 3).
the differences in the percentages shown in table 3, column 5, are the result of a number  of factors, and none of them have been estimated individually.


the variation in the rates  primarily reflects differences in voluntary emigration, removal by dhs, conditions in the  area of origin, and differences in eligibility for adjustment to lawful status.
10 for example,  the  relatively  low  departure  rate  of  16  percent  for  central america  likely  reflects  low  emigration rates due to adverse conditions in that area.


9   as  noted  above,  departures  or  losses  from  the  undocumented  population  can  occur  in  four  ways:  voluntarily emigration, adjustment to lawful status, removal by dhs, or (in a relatively small number of  cases) death.
separate estimates are not available for each of the four ways of leaving the undocumented  population.


10   of course, as with all of the numbers and percentages shown in this paper, sampling variability and non- sampling error can affect the data.

in 2015 (4) 11,045 5,810 1,615 485 680 300 1,740 340 21  the lower percentage for mexico compared to other areas could signify low emigration  rates, but there is another important factor to consider.
very few undocumented residents  with a close family relationship to a us citizen or lawful permanent resident (lpr) that  would qualify them for a visa can adjust to lpr status in the united states, if they entered  without inspection (gubernskaya and dreby 2017, 421, 425; kerwin and warren 2017,  307).


this restriction applies to the majority of undocumented residents from mexico and,  to a lesser extent, those from central american countries.
as a result, many undocumented  beneficiaries  of  approved  visa  petitions  opt  to  remain  in  the  united  states,  rather  than  return home for consular processing, thus foregoing their opportunity to gain immigration  status (kerwin, meissner, and mchugh 2011).


by contrast, undocumented residents who  entered legally and overstayed a temporary visa (i.
e.


, nearly everyone not from mexico or  central america) are permitted to adjust status.
trends in population change, 2008 to 2015, by area of origin  this section argues that even though the estimated populations of some central american  and asian countries appear to be increasing, in most cases the estimated growth is either (1)  not as high as it was in the 2000 to 2008 period, or (2) is the result of imprecision in the data  and estimation procedures.


examples of the latter include asylum seekers being counted as   499  zero undocumented population growth is here to stayundocumented arrivals from central america and undocumented residents returning to the  united states from china in 2015 after leaving the united states for a few years.
the following graphs illustrate changes in undocumented populations from specific areas  or countries in the 2008 to 2015 period.


figure 3 shows population trends separately for  mexico and for all other countries.
figures 4, 5, and 6 address trends in two areas of the  world  asia and central america  with still-growing undocumented populations in the  united states.


in addition to showing the decline in the population from mexico in the 2008 to 2015  period, figure 3 shows that the undocumented population from the rest of the world has  remained generally stable since 2008.
the trend lines in figure 3 provide evidence that  growth of the undocumented population did not resume as the economy recovered.

even though the population from both areas has continued  to increase in recent years, average annual growth for both asia and central america was  lower in the 2008 to 2015 period than it was in the 2000 to 2008 period, as shown in table  1.
the undocumented population from central america was stable at about 1.


5 million each  year from 2010 to 2013 (figure 4).
it is questionable whether the increases in 2014 and  2015 shown for central america in figure 4 actually represent increased undocumented  immigration.


according to a recent report by the center for migration studies citing cbp  (2016), .
.


.
a growing percentage of border crossers in recent years have originated in  the northern triangle states of central america (warren and kerwin 2017, 125).


as cms  and others have argued, many of these migrants are fleeing pervasive violence, persecution  and poverty, and a large number do not seek to evade arrest, but present themselves to  border officials and request political asylum.
many are de facto refugees, not illegal border  crossers (ibid.

figure 5 shows population trends for 2008 to 2015 for asian countries, but china and india  have been combined and separated from all other asian countries.


as figure 5 shows, the  total population of asian countries, after separating out china and india, has been stable at  about 900,000 each year since 2008 (figure 5).
india and china combined accounted for  40 percent of the undocumented population from asia in 2008.


by 2015, india and chinas  share (combined) was approaching half of the undocumented population from asia.

the  population  from  both  countries  increased  during  the  2008  to  2015  period,  with  india  growing by an average of 14,000 per year and china growing by 20,000 annually (table 1).


although the population from india has increased since 2008, annual growth is still less  than it was in the 2000 to 2008 period.
that leaves china as the only large sending country  that had higher population growth in 2008 to 2015 compared to 2000 to 2008.


11 as such,  the trend in population growth from china received extra scrutiny, as described below.
figure 6.


population trends for india and china: 2008 to  2015  s d n a s u o h t   500  450  400  350  300  250  200  150  100   india  china  2008  2010  2011  2012  year  2013  2014  2015  even though the estimated population from china increased by about 50,000 from 2008 to  2010, it held fairly steady from 2010 to 2013 at approximately 300,000 per year (figure 6).
additional analysis revealed that at least half of the increases from china in 2014 and 2015  (20,000 and 62,000, respectively) were the result of the arrival of undocumented residents  who lived in the united states previously and returned to the united states in 2014 and  2015.


the procedure for deriving this type of estimate is shown in table 4.
12  11   the population from el salvador grew faster in 2008 to 2015 than it did in 2000 to 2008, but there is  uncertainty about the percentage of recent arrivals from central america that are actually undocumented  immigrants, as opposed to asylum seekers.


the estimation procedure used to derive these estimates does  not distinguish between recently arrived undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers.
as a result, asylum  seekers are erroneously included in these and other estimates as undocumented residents.


12   table 4 includes only undocumented residents who reported that they arrived in the 2008 to 2012 period.
demographic logic specifies that an entry cohort  in this case those who arrived in 2008 to 2012  should  decrease every year after arrival.


a total of 110,000 were counted in 2014, and about six percent would be  expected to leave the population by 2015 (table 4).
that means about 103,000 (item 2 in table 4) should have  been counted in 2015.


instead, 144,000 were counted in 2015.
the excess of 41,000 is the estimated number  of undocumented residents who originally moved here in the 2008 to 2012 period, left the united states, and  returned in 2015.

94 in item 2 was derived by dividing the 43 percent departure rate for asia in table 3,  column 5, by seven years.
the result is 6 percent per year.


the estimate of 41,000 in table 4 represents about two-thirds of the growth of the population  from china in 2015.
in summary, the undocumented population from china was stable  from 2000 to 2013, and at least half of the growth in 2014 and 2015 was due to the return  of undocumented residents who had moved here previously, left the united states, and  returned.


110,000 103,000 144,000 41,000  changes in overstays and ewis from 2008 to 2015 very little statistical information is available about the number or trends in the overstay  or ewi populations.
information about arrivals and departures from these populations is  presented here for the first time.


the appendix includes a brief description of the methods  used to derive the estimates and provides a reference to a more detailed description of the  methodology.
as table 5 shows, almost twice as many overstayed as entered without inspection in the  2008 to 2015 period  2.


0 million overstays compared to 1.
1 million ewis.


the trend  line for all other countries in figure 3 above shows that this disparity is not the result of  increasing numbers of overstays.
the all other countries population, mostly overstays,  was steady at approximately 5 million from 2008 to 2015; the population from mexico,  mostly ewis, declined by about 780,000, as shown in table 1.


a higher number and percentage of overstays than ewis also left the population from  2008 to 2015 (table 5).
however, even though more overstays than ewis left the 2008  population in this seven-year period, the overstay population still grew by an average of  20,000 per year, while the ewi population declined by an average of 80,000 per year.


the percent of the total undocumented population that were overstays increased from 41  percent in 2008 to 44 percent in 2015.

* undocumented residents can leave the population in four ways: emigrate voluntarily, adjust to lawful  status, be removed by dhs, or (a relatively small number) die.
the differences in the percentages that left the population (table 5, column 5) are difficult  to  assess  until  more  detailed  information  becomes  available.


an  important  question  is:  how do each of the three13 ways of leaving the population  removal by dhs, voluntary  emigration, or adjustment to lawful status  contribute to these differences?
removals  contribute more to the departure percentage of ewis than for overstays; mexico accounted  for 71 percent of all removals by dhs14 in the 2008 to 2015 period.


excluding removals  from  the  data  in  table  5  would  increase,  not  decrease,  the  difference  in  the  estimated  departure rates for the two types of populations.
as noted, most undocumented ewis that  qualify for a visa cannot adjust status in the united states.


this accounts for some of the  differences in the percentages in table 5.
however, even after taking that into account, the  large difference in the percent that left the population most likely indicates that overstays  emigrate at higher rates than ewis.


the differential effects of emigration rates and adjustment of status on the overstay and  ewi populations are illustrated in table 6.
the total populations from honduras and the  philippines were similar in 2008, about 270,000 each (table 6).


both countries received  about 125,000 net arrivals in the 2008 to 2015 period.
notice, however, that the population  from honduras grew by 88,000 in this period, while the population from the philippines  declined by 19,000.


the large difference in population change occurred because 143,000,  or 54 percent of those here in 2008, had left the population from the philippines by 2015,  while only 39,000, or 14 percent, had left the population from honduras.
13   mortality is not likely to be a factor in generating the difference in the percentages in table 5 because  these are relatively young populations with low mortality rates, and there is no reason to expect any difference  in the rates.

column 2 = column 4  column 1 + column 3.


these significant differences in population change for the philippines and honduras  two  countries with similar beginning populations and net arrivals  are likely the result of at  least three factors: (1) some portion of the 2015 population from honduras actually are  asylum seekers, not undocumented residents; (2) relatively more undocumented residents  from the philippines were able to adjust to lawful status; and (3) the voluntary emigration  rate probably is higher for the philippines than for honduras.
the  finding  that  40  percent  of  the  entire  overstay  population  left  the  undocumented  population within seven years is significant.


it means that the excess of overstays compared  to ewis in recent years is not likely to lead to more population growth, but could well  portend additional population decline, as illustrated in the case of the philippines in table  6.
not permitting ewis who qualify for a visa to adjust status in the united states increases  the size of the undocumented population.


it also increases the length of residence in this  country, which leads to increased ties to the united states.
as of 2015, 80 percent of the  undocumented  population  from  mexico  and  central america  had  arrived  before  2008;  only half of those from the rest of the world (nearly all overstays) had arrived before 2008.


conclusions the era of undocumented population growth ended nearly a decade ago.
the population  from mexico has declined steadily for the past seven years, dropping by almost a quarter of  a million in 2015 alone.


this report provides demographic details that explain the transition  from rapid growth (nearly 400,000 in 2000 to 2008) to zero or negative change in the  2008 to 2015 period.
it also includes new estimates of overstays and ewis that show that  overstays greatly exceeded ewis in the 2008 to 2015 period and that overstays leave the  undocumented population at considerably higher rates than ewis.


the report establishes that, contrary to conventional wisdom, the great recession played  little, if any, role in the transformation to zero population growth.
further, growth is not  likely to resume.


the main conditions that stopped population growth  increased scrutiny   505  zero undocumented population growth is here to stayof air travel after 9/11, a decade and a half of greatly increased efforts to reduce illegal  entries across the southern border, large numbers leaving the undocumented population  each year, and improved economic and demographic conditions in mexico  continue to  obtain and will act to check any possible resumption in growth.
even though the estimated populations from some central american and asian countries  are still increasing, in many cases they actually are growing slowly, if at all.


for example,  many  of  the  arrivals  from  the  northern triangle  states  of  central america  are  asylum  seekers but are included in most estimates of undocumented migration because adequate  statistics are not available to remove them from this population.
much of the apparent  growth in the population from china in 2014 and 2015 is not due to new arrivals but to the  return to the united states of undocumented immigrants who arrived in earlier years.


the cessation of population growth is a significant milestone in the history of undocumented  immigration to the united states.
it is time to recognize that zero population growth is here  to stay and that it is very much in our self-interest to seize this opportunity to reform the  us legal immigration system in order to preserve and extend these gains.


appendix a.
estimation of the undocumented resident population cms used the procedures below (steps 1 to 5) to derive estimates of the undocumented  resident population in 2010.


the same steps15 were followed to derive estimates for 2008  and for each year from 2011 to 2015.
the classification of noncitizens as undocumented  residents was done at the microdata level, and the estimates described here were compiled  from  those  detailed  data  sets.


warren  (2014)  provides  a  detailed  description  of  the  methodology and compares the cms estimates based on this methodology to estimates  derived using the residual method.
step 1.


the first step in the estimation procedure was to compile data from the 2010 acs  for all noncitizens who entered the united states from 1982 to 2010.
it was assumed that  nearly all undocumented residents are in the category noncitizens who entered the us after  1981.


very few who entered before 1982 would still be residing here as undocumented  residents in 2010 because: (1) a large percentage of those who entered before 1982 obtained  legal status under the immigration reform and control act of 1986 (irca);16 and (2) those  who entered before 1982 and did not apply for legalization have had more than 25 years in  which to leave the undocumented resident population  that is, to adjust to legal status, be  removed, leave voluntarily, or die.
15   actually, the country-by-country selection ratios for 2010, computed in step 3, were used in step 4 for  every year; independent population controls were computed only for 2010.


16   irca went into effect in 1987.
two groups were eligible for legalization, each with their own residency  requirements: legalization applicants who continuously resided in the united states since before january 1,  1982, and special agricultural workers (saws) who had 60 days of seasonal agricultural work experience  in qualifying crops from may 1985 to may 1986.

6 million legalization applicants and 1.


1 million  saw applicants were approved (warren and kerwin 2015b).

a series of edits, referred to as logical edits,17 were used to identify and remove  as many legal residents as possible based on responses in the survey.
step  3.


separate  population  controls  were  estimated  for  145  countries  or  areas  for  undocumented residents counted in the 2010 acs.
for each country or area, the ratio of  the population control to the logically edited population (from step 2) was computed.


step 4.
the country-by-country ratios derived in step 3 were used to make final selections  of individual respondents in the acs to be classified as undocumented residents.


step  5.
the  estimates  of  those  counted  in  the  acs  (from  step  4)  were  adjusted  for  undercount.


b.
estimation of overstays and ewis estimates of overstays for this report are based partly on estimates of overstays, by country  of  origin  for  2015  released  by  dhs  (2016).


those  estimates  were  derived  primarily  from  the  arrival  departure  information  system  (adis),  which  tracks  the  arrival  and  departure of temporary visitors admitted for business or pleasure.
additional details about  the methodology used to estimate overstays is included in a cms report released earlier  this year (warren and kerwin 2017).


estimates of ewis were computed by subtracting  estimates of overstays from cms estimates of the total undocumented population for 2008  and 2015.
