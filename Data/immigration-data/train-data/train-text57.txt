creating a more responsive and  seamless refugee protection  system: the scope, promise and  limitations of us temporary  protection programs  donald kerwin center for migration studies  executive summary temporary protection programs can provide haven to endangered persons  while states and nongovernmental organizations (ngos) work to create  durable  solutions  in  sending,  host  and  third  countries.
1  they  have  the  potential to further the interests of forced migrants in protection, states  in effective and coordinated migration management, and the international  community in solidarity.


us temporary protection programs rest primarily on executive discretion  and  have  not  been  substantially  revisited  for  nearly  25  years.
parole  represents the primary vehicle for temporarily admitting noncitizens for  emergency and humanitarian reasons.


2  prior to 1980, the united states  used parole to admit large refugee and refugee-like populations to whom (in  most cases) it later extended lawful permanent resident (lpr) status.
the  1980 refugee act made the us refugee resettlement program the primary  vehicle for refugee admissions, limited the use of parole to individuals (not  groups), and created a presumption against granting parole to refugees.


the  united  states  provides  immigrant  (permanent)  visas  to  abused,  neglected  and  abandoned  children,  as  well  as  to  certain  iraqis  and  afghanis who worked for the us military or for military contractors.
it  can also award up to 5,000 nonimmigrant (temporary) t visas each year  to victims of human trafficking and up to 10,000 nonimmigrant u visas  to survivors of crime who assist law enforcement officials in investigating  and prosecuting crimes.


however, since 1980, the united states has lacked  a dedicated legal vehicle for admitting other refugee-like populations.
1  temporary protection refers to the universe of programs that provide safe haven to persons who would be  at risk in their home or host countries.


temporary protected status (tps) is the us program that offers group  protection to noncitizens from designated states.

jmhs volume 2 number 1 (2014): 44-72temporary  protected  status  (tps)  applies  to  noncitizens  from  states  experiencing  armed conflict, the aftermath of natural disaster, or other  extraordinary, temporary conditions that make it unsafe to return.
the tps  statute allows the secretary of the us department of homeland security  (dhs) to designate states or regions within states for tps, although the  united states has never limited tps to substate groups.


tps does not cover  persons from designated states who arrive following the effective date of  the  designation,  even  those  who  fled  great  peril.
tps  recipients  cannot  petition for the admission of close family members.


in addition, tps cannot  be granted to persons in substantial need of protection from undesignated  states.
like  refugees  and  asylees,  tps  recipients  receive  work  authorization.


unlike refugees or asylees, they are not eligible for resettlement benefits  or deemed qualified for most federal public benefit programs.
they can  apply for political asylum and immigration benefits.


however, tps does  not, in itself, lead to permanent status or other durable solutions.
beyond tps, the executive branch can exercise its discretion not to remove  persons who fall outside its law enforcement priorities, including persons  who might otherwise suffer violence, extraordinary hardship, or death at  home.


this paper outlines international standards for the design and operation  of  temporary  protection  programs,  describes  the  us  refugee  protection  program writ large, and identifies gaps in protection.
it recommends that  congress create a nonimmigrant protection visa for noncitizens who are  at substantial risk of persecution, danger, or harm in their home or host  countries, and that dhs expand its use of parole for de facto refugees and  individuals in refugee-like situations.


it also argues that the united states  should prioritize the reconstruction and development of tps-designated  states  and  work  to  establish  regional  migration  and  development  agreements covering north america, central america and the caribbean.
congress should also pass legislation to extend lpr status to long-term  recipients of temporary protection.


in particular, it should advance the  registry  date  to  january  1,  1999  (which  would  provide  lpr  status  to  most noncitizens in the country since that date) and it should automatically  move up the registry cut-off date each year thereafter by one year.
it should  also  pass  broad  immigration  reform  legislation,  including  a  legalization  program that would credit years in receipt of temporary protection toward  the time required to  earn legalization.


and it should allow temporary  protection recipients to apply affirmatively for cancellation of removal  (which brings lpr status) after 10 years.
dhs should also create a more inclusive tps determination process by  hosting  quarterly  public  hearings  on  conditions  in  tps-designated  and   45  creating a more responsive and seamless refugee protection systemtps-eligible nations.


it should also re-designate more states for tps in  order  to  allow  persons  from  designated  states  who  have  fled  dangerous  conditions and entered the united states between the initial designation  and re-designation periods to qualify for tps.
international perspectives on temporary protection the united nations high commissioner for refugees (unhcr), the council of the europeanunion(eucouncil),theeuropeancouncilonrefugeesandexiles(ecre) and refugee advocates generally align on the optimal scope, use and characteristics of temporary protection programs.


accordingtothisroughconsensus,temporaryprotectionprogramsshouldnotbeusedas asubstitutetorefugeestatus,todelayagrantofrefugeestatus,ortodeteranddenyentry tothoseseekingprotection.

a properly structured temporary protection program can encourage states to allow access  to their territory by ensuring that they will not be permanently and solely responsible for  the  imperiled  persons  that  they  admit.


frontline  states  can  condition  the  admission  of  refugeesandrefugee-likepopulationsonthefinancialandresettlementcommitmentsof moredistantstates(fitzpatrick2000,283,286).

61  creating a more responsive and seamless refugee protection systemrecommendations the  united  states  should  expand  its  capacity  to  admit  limited  numbers  of  de  facto  refugees and others who are at substantial risk of persecution, danger or harm in their  home or host countries.
