piecing together the                       us immigrant detention puzzle  one night at a time: an analysis  of all persons in dhs-ice custody  on september 22, 20121  donald kerwin center for migration studies  with daniela alulema (center for migration studies) and siqi tu (center for  migration studies)  executive summary this paper analyzes a dataset of every person in the custody of the us  department of homeland security immigration and customs enforcement  (dhs-ice or ice) on september 22, 2012, and compares this data with  an earlier analysis of a similar dataset on detainees in dhs-ice custody  on january 25, 2009.
dhs-ice provided the 2012 and 2009 datasets in  response to freedom of information act (foia) requests from the boston  globe and associated press.


the paper sets forth findings related to: (1) the  removal adjudication processes to which the detainees were subject; (2) the  facilities in which they were held; (3) their length of detention; and (4) their  criminal histories, if any.
it finds that on september 22, 2012:   dhs-ice held 35,197 people in its custody.


18,470 detainees had pending removal cases, 14,674 had been ordered  removed, and 2,053 cases included no information on whether or not the  detainee had been ordered removed.
thirty-eight percent of detainees were subject to summary, non-court   removal processes.


forty percent of detainees were from the northern triangle states of  central america and 34 percent from mexico, compared to 37 percent  from mexico and 28 percent from central america on january 25, 2009.
detainees were held in 189 facilities, with 77 percent concentrated in   nine states and 51 percent in the four states that border mexico.


dhs-ice  held  67  percent  of  all  detainees  in  facilities  owned  and/ or  administered  by  for-profit  prison  corporations  and  90  percent  of  detainees in the 21 facilities with the largest detention populations.
1  the  authors  would  like  to  acknowledge  and  extend  their  thanks  to  mark  noferi  for  his  initial  review,  assessment, and research on the september 22, 2012 detention dataset.

jmhs volume 3 number 4 (2015): 330-376  forty-seven percent of detainees had been held for less than 30 days,   and 4,179 (12 percent) had been held for more than six months.
of  those  ordered  removed  and  continuously  detained  in  the  interim,  553 persons had been detained for more than six months after being  ordered removed, despite being presumptively eligible for release after  six months.


sixty-one percent of detainees had criminal convictions, compared to 42   percent on january 25, 2009.
less  than  10  percent  of  all  detainees  on  september  22,  2012  had  committed violent crimes and substantial percentages  a higher rate  than  on  january  25,  2009    had  committed  traffic  and  immigration  violations.


the paper argues that dhs-ice should collect extensive data on detainees,  make  it  broadly  available  on  a  consistent  basis,  and  become  more  transparent and accountable to the public.
it recommends that:   dhs-ice comprehensively analyze its detention information systems  and  data  collection  to  ensure  that  the  agency  can  meet  its  legal  imperatives, operational responsibilities, and detention standards.


dhs-ice initiate a process to engage congress, other federal agencies,  states,  scholars,  researchers,  and  non-governmental  organizations  (ngos) on the detention information and data that it should collect and  make publicly available.
dhs-ice release its enforce alien removal module (earm) and the  enforce  alien  booking  modules  (eabm)  manual  that  describes  the  detention information it collects, and that it regularly release extensive  data on all those held in its custody.


dhs-ice  work  with  the  immigration  courts  and  detainee  states  of   origin to avoid prolonged and indefinite detention in all cases.
dhs-ice collect complete and accurate data and that it not leave data   fields blank or fill them out incorrectly.


congress  and  dhs-ice  substantially  expand  community-based,   supervised release, alternative-to-detention programs.
congress and dhs-ice reduce, if not eliminate, the role of for-profit  entities in administering immigrant detention facilities, and take full  responsibility for this core government responsibility.


introduction over  the  last  20  years,  government  research  and  accountability  agencies  and  non- governmental organizations (ngos) have created a substantial body of knowledge on the  operation of the us immigrant detention system.
by and large, however, policy makers,  researchers, the public, and even front-line immigration officials have not had the benefit  of information on detainees collected by the us department of homeland security (dhs).


in addition, dhs has never released a complete list of the fields of data that it collects on  immigrant detainees or the facilities that hold them.
nor has it released even a redacted   331  piecing together the us immigrant detention puzzleversion of the enforce alien removal module (earm) and the enforce alien booking  modules  (eabm)  manual,  which  reportedly  describes  the  information  dhs  collects  and tracks on detainees, the officials responsible for entering and screening this data, and  those who can access this information.


dhs implausibly claims that this manual is law  enforcement sensitive.
although  hardly  sufficient,  dhss  immigration  and  customs  enforcement  (dhs-ice  or  ice)  agency  has  released  two  datasets  with  distinct  sets  of  data  fields  in  response  to  freedom  of  information act  (foia)  requests  by associated  press  reporter  michelle  roberts and boston globe reporter maria sacchetti.


the datasets provide a rare glimpse of  the us immigrant detention system on the nights of january 25, 2009 and september 22,  2012.
roberts and sacchetti relied on the 2009 and 2012 datasets, respectively, to report on  long-term detention (roberts 2009; sacchetti 2014).


an analysis of the 2009 dataset by the  migration policy institute concluded that ice did not appear to track all of the information  it would need to assess eligibility for release or compliance with its detention standards  (kerwin and lin 2009, 5).
an examination of detainees on a particular night or nights offers a limited and potentially  skewed view of the detention system.


for example, it yields a higher percentage of long-term  detainees than would an analysis of a dataset of all dhs detainees over the course of a year.
however, a point-in-time analysis can produce valuable information on the demographic  characteristics of detainees; the types and concentration of detention facilities; length of  detention  for  persons  in  different  removal  processes;  and  the  criminal  backgrounds  of  detainees.


coupled with other information, single-day datasets also offer insight into the  effect of particular enforcement programs and patterns of immigration violations.
analyses  of multiple point-in-time datasets can suggest long-term trends in detention and removal.


the 2009 and 2012 datasets contain some overlapping fields, which allow for comparison  of the detainee populations on two days, 44 months apart.
this paper will summarize key findings from an analysis by the center for migration studies  of new york (cms) of the september 22, 2012 dataset, and will compare these findings  with those from the analysis of the january 25, 2009 dataset.


the paper will begin with a  description of the dhs-ice enforce database and a summary of the fields contained  in the 2009 and 2012 datasets.
it will then set forth findings and will conclude with policy  recommendations.


the enforce database dhs-ice operates the enforcement integrated database (eid), which is a shared common  database repository with information on the investigation, arrest, booking, detention, and  removal of persons encountered by ice, customs and border protection (cbp), and us  citizenship and immigration services (uscis) (dhs 2011).
dhs personnel previously  accessed the data in eid using the enforce alien detention module (eadm), and  enforce alien removal module (earm), but eadm has been merged into earm  (ibid.


).
2  in  recent  years,  earm  has  added  information  on  electronic  bond  processing,  2   eadm and earm replaced the dhs deportable alien control system (dacs) on september 30, 2007  (dhs-oig 2009).


dacs was created, in part, to enable the immigration and naturalization service (ins)   332  journal on migration and human securityselect ice detention policies (like telephone calls following transfer), medical screening,  eligibility for alternative-to-detention (atd) programs, and criminal history (ibid.
, 9-12).


dhs-ice has also added to earm a new tab on its risk classification assessment (rca).
the rca guides ice determinations on eligibility for release, atd programs, and placement  within the system based on flight risk and public safety concerns (dhs 2012, 3-4).


on august 22, 2012, the boston globe submitted a foia request for data on every detainee  in ice custody, including information on:   country of origin; criminal convictions;    name and date of birth (or age) of each detainee;       most serious criminal conviction;     date of final removal order.
total number of days in ice custody; and  ice  initially  responded  to  the  request  with  date  of  birth  and  other  data  fields,  but  subsequently informed the boston globe that it had provided some inaccurate information  and had improperly provided the date of birth information.


it subsequently released eight  fields of data for the night of september 22, 2012:                    citizenship; criminal yes/no (convicted of a crime); most  serious  criminal  charge  (based  on  national  crime  information  center  (ncic) categorization);3 detention facility;  v_days_in_custody (days in custody from most recent apprehension); final order yes/no; final order date (the date the removal order became administratively final); and case category (the type of removal process and posture of case).
ice indicated that the data came from its enforcement and removal operations (ero)  division.


however, it did not provide a comprehensive list of data fields within this dataset  or an explanation of the fields for which data was provided.
nor would ice-ero officials  subsequently  clarify  ambiguous  fields,  including  case  category  codes  or  indicate  the  dhs officials (likely deportation officers or immigration enforcement agents) who entered  the data.


cms has pieced together some of this information from the analysis of the 2009  dataset and from other sources.
the case category field included a series of codes and descriptors which speak to the  type of removal proceeding and posture of the case.


analysis of the information captured   and department of justice (doj) to count and report on those it had under docket control and to track  non-citizens, both detainees and non-detainees, from the point that they were initially encountered by dhs  officials until their departure or the closure of their cases.
3   the ncic is the federal bureau of investigations clearinghouse and database of crime data, which  can be accessed by federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies.


the most serious criminal  charge does not necessarily reflect the crime which serves as the ground for removability (kerwin and lin  2009, 23).
333  piecing together the us immigrant detention puzzlein this field reflects changes to the us immigration system brought about by the illegal  immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 (iirira).


prior to iirira,  removable non-citizens fell into two general categories: the deportable and the excludable.
earm has retained this nomenclature.


non-citizens who had entered the country pre- iirira had greater constitutional rights and were placed in deportation proceeding, while  those stopped at a port of entry or apprehended near a border were deemed to be excludable  based on the legal fiction that they had not entered the country.
iirira combined deportation and exclusion into a uniform removal process and replaced  the term entry with admission, which it defined as a lawful entry  after inspection  and authorization.


4 thus, post-iirira, non-citizens who illegally enter the country are  deemed inadmissible because they have not been inspected and authorized.
immigration  law  has  also  retained  separate  grounds  of  inadmissibility  (which  apply  to  those  not  admitted) and deportability (which apply to those admitted).


5 non-citizens who are subject  to  grounds  of  inadmissibility  bear  the  burden  of  showing  that  they  are  admissible.
by  contrast, the government bears the burden of showing that non-citizens are deportable.


iirira  also  created  several  summary  and  expedited  removal  processes  which  do  not  include  an  appearance  before  an  immigration  judge  (ij)  (aclu  2014,  15-30).
these  informal processes have been applied to a sharply escalating number and percentage of  persons facing removal since 1996.


expedited removal, for example, applies to non-citizens who attempt to enter the united  states without entry documents or by using improper documents, who are arrested within  100 miles of us land and coastal borders, and who have been present in the united states  for less than two years.
this process accounted for 193,032 removals or 44 percent of  all removals in 2013 (simansky 2014, 5).


reinstatement of removal applies to persons  who  have  been  ordered  removed  or  have  departed  voluntarily  while  under  a  removal  order, and who illegally re-enter the united states.
6 this process accounted for 170,247  removals or 39 percent of all removals in 2013 (ibid.


).
administrative removal applies to  non-citizens who are not lawful permanent residents (lprs) and who have committed an  aggravated felony.


there were 127,376 administrative removals from fy 2003 to fy  2013 (rosenblum and mccabe 2014, 23).
stipulated orders of removal, which must be  signed by an ij, can nonetheless occur without a hearing when a non-citizen admits the  factual claims against him or her, concedes deportability or inadmissibility, and waives his  or her right to appeal the removal order (aclu 2014, 29).


7 dhs does not report on the  number of stipulated removals each year.
earms case category field includes codes that capture these distinct removal processes,  the case posture and, in some instances, its disposition.


brief descriptions of the codes  follow:  4   immigration and nationality act (ina)  101(a)(13)(a).
5   ina  212; ina  237.

15   this category does not necessarily reflect the crime which serves as the grounds for removability or the  basis of detention (kerwin and lin 2009, 23).


16   in the past, dhs-ice often underestimated the days in custody set forth in this field by treating a  transfer as a release for statistical and reporting purposes; that is, days in custody reflected only the days  in the facility in question, not continuous days in custody.
this problem has reportedly been corrected.


336  journal on migration and human securityorder yes/no (whether the detainee received a final removal order); and final order  date, (the date the removal order became administratively final).
findings congress has mandated that dhs maintain at least 34,000 immigration detention beds each  night.


17 to meet this requirement, dhs-ice operates its own facilities, and additionally  contracts to use facilities owned by: (1) the federal bureau of prisons; (2) for-profit prison  corporations;  and  (3)  states  and  localities  that  frequently  sub-contract  with  for-profit  prisons to operate or administer their jails and prisons.
many dhs-ice contractual and  sub-contractual  agreements  guarantee  that  private  correctional  agencies  will  be  paid  for a minimum number of detainees per night, no matter how many people the facilities  actually hold (dwn and ccr 2015).


in this way, the contracts incentivize filling detention  facilities each night (ibid.
, 6-7).


on september 22, 2012, dhs-ice held 35,197 persons in its custody, compared to 32,000  on january 25, 2009.
the number of persons in custody on september 22, 2012 exceeds  dhs-ices average daily bed use in 2012, but tracks the overall expansion of the detention  system between 2009 and 2012 (chart 1).


chart 1.
average daily population of detainees, fy 1994- 2013  sources: siskin 2004, 2012; dhs-oig 2014.


one would expect that the process for determining whether a non-citizen should be removed  would take longer on average than the act of physically removing a person ordered removed.
if this were the case, then the vast majority of detainees would be in removal proceedings  and a far smaller percentage would have been ordered removed.

18 thus, a surprisingly high percentage  (44 percent) of the 33,144 detainees for whom the final order field was completed had  received final orders.


of the 2,053 cases which had no final order information, 2,009 had  been detained for less than six months, 35 for between six months and a year, and nine for  more than one year.
the january 25, 2009 dataset included 18,690 detainees in removal  proceedings, 10,873 who had received a final order of removal, and 2,437 for whom this  field was left blank.

however, consistent with expanded use of informal removal processes post-iirira, 38  percent of detainees were in summary, expedited, and administrative removal processes,  including:    5,866 (16.

in both 2009 and 2012, immigrant detainees originated from the great majority of nations  in  the  world,  although  citizens  of  mexico,  central  american  and  caribbean  nations  predominated.
detainees  in  the  2009  dataset  came  from  177  nations,  with  the  largest  population (37 percent) from mexico and 28 percent from central america.


on september  22, 2012, dhs-ice detained persons from 177 nations, with 40 percent from the northern  triangle states of central america and 34 percent from mexico (table 1).
19 the decrease  in  the  percentage  of  mexican  detainees  between  2009  and  2012  is  consistent  with  the  dramatic drop in arrivals to the united states from mexico between 2000 and 2012 and  the decrease in the mexican us unauthorized population from 2010 to 2013 (warren and  kerwin 2015, 87-89).

9  the privatization of the us immigrant detention system over the last six years, the obama administration has pursued administrative reforms of  the us immigrant detention system.


a centerpiece of this initiative has been strengthened  oversight of dhs contract facilities.
the 2009 and 2012 datasets indicate the facility in which  each detainee was held.


one way that dhs-ice has attempted to tighten accountability  has been to reduce the number of contract facilities.
on january 25, 2009, ice detained  immigrants  in  286  facilities,  with  68  percent  in  nine  states  (california, arizona,  new  mexico, texas, arkansas, louisiana, alabama, georgia, and florida) and 47 percent in  the  four  us  states  that  border  mexico  (kerwin  and  lin  2009,  8-9).


by  september  22,  2012, the number of contract facilities in use had fallen, and ice detention populations  had become even more concentrated.
in particular, ice held immigrants in 189 facilities,  with  77  percent  of  detainees  in  nine  states  (texas,  california, arizona,  georgia,  new  jersey, louisiana, florida, washington, and pennsylvania) and 51 percent in the four states  bordering mexico.


the composition of the facilities used by dhs-ice changed little between january 25,  2009 and september 22, 2012.
on january 25, 2009, ice held 68 percent of detainees in  local jails and state prisons pursuant to inter-governmental service agreements (igsas),  17 percent in for-profit contract detention facilities (cdfs), 10 percent in its own service  processing  centers  (spcs),  3  percent  in  shelters  and  other  alternative  facilities,  and  2  percent in federal prisons (kerwin and lin 2009, 8).


20  20   by 2014, privately owned facilities held 19 percent of immigrant detainees (usccb-mrs and cms  2015, 13).

given that the cdf category does not account for the operation by for-profit corporations  of state and local facilities that are under igsas with the federal government, that category  significantly understates the degree to which the detention system has been privatized.


on  january 25, 2009, for example, for-profit prisons owned and/or operated 75 percent of the  beds in the 17 most populated detention facilities, which held 51 percent of all detainees  (kerwin and lin 2009, 14-15).
on september 22, 2012, for-profit prisons owned and/or  operated 90 percent of the beds in the 21 facilities that held 52 percent of all detainees  (appendix a; figure 2).

moreover, for-profit prison agencies owned and/or operated 67 percent of all detention  beds on september 22, 2012 (figure 3).


with the opening of immense new private facilities  in 2014 and 2015, these numbers have likely increased since 2012.

341  piecing together the us immigrant detention puzzlelength of detention   length of detention post-removal order   the us supreme court has prohibited the indefinite detention of non-citizens who have  been ordered removed.
in its 2001 decision in zadvydas v.


davis, the court held that six  months after a final order of removal, the government must either release a detainee or  demonstrate a significant likelihood that the detainee will be removed in the reasonably  foreseeable  future.
22  if  the  government  cannot  meet  this  burden,  the  detainee  must  be  released.


in  2003,  the  court  extended  this  decision  to  inadmissible  persons  who  are  ordered removed.
23 in combination, these decisions have led to a dramatic decrease in the  number of post-removal order, long-term detainees (kerwin and lin 2009, 18, note 36).


however, these decisions do not apply to persons in pending proceedings; i.
e.


, who have  not yet been ordered removed.
in a 2003 decision, the court upheld mandatory detention  for what it assumed to be the brief period necessary to complete removal proceedings.


24  these decisions raise two principal empirical issues: whether dhs is removing detainees  within  six  months  of  their  removal  orders,  and  whether  the  detention  of  persons  with  pending removal proceedings is, in fact, brief.
the analysis of the september 22, 2012  dataset reveals, as did the 2009 dataset, that while in most cases detention is relatively  brief, large numbers of detainees have been confined for prolonged periods on any given  night, including 553 for more than six months after being ordered removed.


25  on september 22, 2012, 6,298 detainees had received a final order and had been detained  since receiving the order (table 3).
these detainees had, on average, been detained for  64 days following receipt of their removal order.


26 more specifically, 5,018 detainees (80  percent) had been detained following receipt of a removal order for less than 90 days; 727  (12 percent) had been detained for between 90 days and six months; 409 (6 percent) had  been detained for between six months and one year; and 144 (2 percent) had been detained  for one year or more (table 3).
of the 10,771 post-removal order detainees on january 25,  2009, 8,513 (79 percent) had been detained post-removal order for less than 90 days; 1,266  (12 percent) for 90 days to six months; 676 (6 percent) for six months to one year; and 316  (3 percent) for one year or more (kerwin and lin 2009, 17).

kim, 538 us 510 (2003).


25   the overall number of detainees who were detained on september 22, 2012 more than six months after  receiving their removal order  both those continuously in detention since being ordered removed and  those who had not been continuously detained since being ordered removed  was 951.
26   a second group of 8,371 detainees on september 22, 2012 had been ordered removed but had not been  continuously detained since receiving their removal order.


this could have occurred for different reasons.
some could have been ordered removed in absentia and later been arrested and detained.


others could have  been ordered removed, absconded, and subsequently been rearrested.

the data from the dhs-ice  database for september 22, 2012 did not indicate whether or not a final order had been entered for 2,053  detainees.
in addition, the database was missing a final-order date for five post-removal order detainees.

of the 18,470 detainees with pending removal cases on september 22, 2012, 13,281 (72  percent) had been detained for less than 90 days; 2,932 (16 percent) had been detained  for between 90 days and six months; 1,534 (8 percent) had been detained for between six  months and one year; and 723 (4 percent) had been detained for one year or more.


by way  of comparison, of the 18,690 detainees with pending removal cases on january 25, 2009,  13,842 (74 percent) had been detained for less than 90 days; 2,486 (13 percent) had been  detained for 90 days to six months; 1,792 (10 percent) from six months to one year; and  570 (3 percent) for one year or more (kerwin and lin 2009, 16).
the average total length of detention for post-removal order detainees on september 22,  2012 (both prior to and after receiving a removal order) was 143 days, and 1,480 who had  been continuously detained after receiving a removal order had been detained for more  than six months.


the average total length of detention for post-removal order detainees on  january 25, 2009 was 114 days and 1,792 post-removal order detainees had been detained  for more than six months.
343  piecing together the us immigrant detention puzzleseventy-one  percent  of  the  144  detainees  in  custody  on  september  22,  2012  for  more  than one year after receiving a removal order came from the following nine countries:  mexico (29 cases), el salvador (26 cases), jamaica (15 cases), guatemala (nine cases),  india (six cases), nigeria (six cases), philippines (five cases), nicaragua (three cases), and  rwanda (three cases).


in comparison, more than one-half of the 316 detainees in custody  for more than one year post-removal order on january 25, 2009 came from the following  10 countries: mexico (28 cases), china (28 cases), el salvador (19 cases), india (19 cases),  jamaica (17 cases), the philippines (13 cases), haiti (13 cases), dominican republic (12  cases), russia (nine cases), and kenya (eight cases).
on september 22, 2012, four detention facilities held detainees for an average of one year  or more.


on january 25, 2009, 10 detention facilities held detainees for an average of one  year or more.
these 10 facilities tended to hold small number of detainees, with many  being soft detention or social service centers.


the 10 persons in detention for the longest periods as of september 22, 2012 had been  in custody from between nearly six years to more than 17 years (appendix b).
however,  some of these figures may be unreliable.


in five cases, for example, the final order date came  years after the detainee had been in custody, well beyond the typical removal adjudication  period.
27 the dataset indicated that two long-term detainees had not received a final order  of removal.


in another two cases, the period in custody was shorter than the period from the  final order to september 22, 2012, indicating that the detainee had been out of custody at  some point after receiving the final order.
in addition, maria sacchetti (2014) reported on  a very long-term cuban detainee who had been mistakenly excluded from the september  22, 2012 dataset.


length of detention  all detainees  the 2009 mpi analysis concluded that dhs-ice must, in effect, operate two detention  systems within one, one for short-term detainees and the other for long-term detainees  (kerwin and lin 2009, 20).
cmss analysis of the september 22, 2012 dataset found the  same dichotomy.


on the one hand, 26,200 detainees (74 percent) had been held for 90 days  or less on september 22, 2012, with 16,427 of them (47 percent of all detainees) held for 30  days or less, and 5,252 (15 percent) held for a week or less.
28 on the other hand, 4,179 (12  percent) had been detained for more than six months, with substantial populations detained  for more than one year (1,497 or 4 percent), 314 persons (slightly less than 1 percent) for  more than two years, and 112 (0.


3 percent) for more than three years.
29   27   one possible explanation might be that the database in some of these cases included prison time served,  as well as time in immigrant detention.


28   the average (mean) length of detention for september 22, 2012 was 84 days, including 85 days for  pre-removal order detainees and 89 days for post-removal order detainees.
the average length of detention  on january 25, 2009 was 81 days for pre-removal order detainees and 114 days for post-removal order  detainees.


29   by way of comparison, 4,154 persons had been detained for more than six months as of january 25,  2009 (kerwin and lin 2009, 19).

it  reveals  that  long-term detainees can be found in large numbers among deportable non-citizens, with  the  highest  numbers  and  percentages  in  the  deportable-administratively  final  order  field.
substantial numbers of long-term detainees can also be found in the excludable/ inadmissible fields, which cover detainees with pending cases and those ordered removed.


smaller, but not insignificant numbers of long-term detainees were in expedited removal  on september 22, 2012, but had been referred for credible fear interviews; that is, they  were asylum seekers.
detainees  without  a  criminal  conviction  had  been  detained  on  average  for  52  days  on  september 22, 2012, and those with criminal convictions had been detained on average for  104 days.


non-criminal detainees had been detained an average of 65 days on january 25,  2009, compared to 121 days for detainees with criminal convictions.
criminal convictions the  enforce  database  classifies  detainees  with  criminal  convictions  (marked  simply yes or no) according to the most serious criminal charge based on ncics  criminal offense classifications.


ncic classifies individual crimes into broad categories  like  dangerous  drugs  and  traffic  offenses,  and  lists  specific  offenses  under  these  categories.
thus, the immigration category encompasses individual offenses like illegal  entry,  false  citizenship,  smuggling  aliens,  possession  of  fraudulent  immigration  documents,  trafficking  of  fraudulent  immigration  documents,  and  illegal  re-entry  (dhs-ice 2013b).

conclusion and recommendations the  us  department  of  homeland  security  combined  22  previously  distinct  federal  agencies  and  departments  and  sought  to  unify  the  homeland  security  response  of  100  federal organizations (bush 2012).


dhs also assumed the responsibilities of the merged  agencies and departments that were not directly related to securing the homeland.
30 for  any federal agency, much less one of dhss breadth and scope, this transformation occurred  at lightning speed.


just nine days after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, president bush announced  the  creation  of  a  new  white  house  office  of  homeland  security  under  the  leadership  of  pennsylvania  governor tom  ridge.
in  june  2002,  following  a  series  of  federal  law  enforcement and intelligence agency restructurings, the president proposed the creation  of dhs, which he envisioned as a single, unified homeland security structure which  would improve protection against todays threats and be flexible enough to help meet the  unknown threats of the future (bush 2002).


on november 25, 2002, the president signed  into law the homeland security act of 2002, which created dhs.
the agency became a  live concern in january 2003.

349  piecing together the us immigrant detention puzzlein  its  own  words,  dhs  represents  a  strengthened,  unified,  integrated  and  more  effective response to threats to us national security (dhs 2015).


however, dhs has  not produced data or analysis commensurate with the importance of its mission, its rapid  growth or its immense size.
nor has the establishment of dhs led to greater transparency  regarding its operations or more thorough analysis of its performance.


its paucity of data  collection and analysis and its lack of transparency have frustrated policy makers, dhs  staff, and the public.
this failure has also contributed to confusion and polarization over  the nations immigration policy goals and its success in meeting them.


a 2013 council on foreign relations (cfr) report on managing illegal immigration  recommended that the administration release its enforcement data to outside researchers  and that dhs recruit and support internal researchers, encourage them to work on these  [enforcement] issues and interact with academic researchers, and approve their work for  public dissemination (roberts, alden, and whitley 2013, 51).
the report attributed public  skepticism regarding the efficacy of us immigration enforcement efforts in part to dhss  failure to measure and evaluate its enforcement efforts and to make public the results of  the small amount of analysis that it had produced (ibid.


, 1).
scholars, researchers, and ngos represent a potential treasure trove of information, data  and  analysis  for  policy  makers  and  dhs  leadership.


yet  access  to  dhs  data  by  these  potential  sources  of  knowledge  and  expertise  has  been  limited,  and  mostly  channeled  through a coterie of dhs public relations and communications officials.
the ability to  secure information and data  or even to determine what data dhs collects  has too  often required a commitment to engage in lengthy, sometimes costly, often unsatisfying  foia  requests;  to  participate  in  an  array  of  liaison  meetings  and  processes  with  dhs  officials; and to characterize the purposes of data requests as ultimately beneficial and fair  to dhs.


a recent report by the national immigrant justice center (nijc), for example, recounted a  four-year ordeal to try to secure detention contracts and facility oversight reports through  a  foia  request  (valenzuela  and  cullen  2015,  3).
nijcs  efforts  ultimately  led  to  the  revelation  that,  although  performance-based  national  detention  standards  (pbnds)  have been a hallmark of dhs-ices six-year detention reform initiative, only 12 of the 94  detention contracts received by nijc stipulated that facilities should adhere to the most  recent pbnds standards (ibid.


, 6).
although the separation of civil immigrant detainees  and criminal populations has been a linchpin of dhs-ices administrative reform efforts,  cmss research also raised the possibility of the commingling of these populations pursuant  to usms iga agreements and (perhaps) in other types of facilities as well.


access to reliable and relevant data has also been a challenge for dhs decision makers,  one of whom recently argued (in a conversation with the author) that government officials  face greater barriers than ngos in accessing agency data, given their inability to submit  foia requests.
congressional oversight of dhs has also been dysfunctional.


dhs reports to more than 90  congressional committees and subcommittees (markon 2014), and many hearings seem  little more than an opportunity for political grandstanding and theater.
at best, the level of  dhs reporting required by congress demands excessive time and resources and, at worst, it   350  journal on migration and human securitydistracts dhs leadership from their homeland security and other responsibilities.


dhs also  receives constant requests for information from the press, academics, researchers, ngos,  and the public.
the most efficient and transparent way to manage this volume of requests  would be for dhs to make as much data publicly available as it can on a consistent basis.


yet despite vast expansion of dhs immigration operations, the agencys annual statistical  and other reports have not become more comprehensive, nuanced, or informative.
the  analysis  of  the  january  25,  2009  detention  dataset  recommended  that  dhs-ice  undertake  a  thorough  inventory  and  review  of  its  information  systems,  including  enforce,  to  ensure  that  they  allow  for  informed  decisions  related  to  eligibility  for  release,  custody  review  processes,  placement  in  alternative-to-detention  programs,  and  compliance  with  its  national  detention  standards  (kerwin  and  lin  2009,  25).


earlier  this  year,  the  us  conference  of  catholic  bishops  (usccb)  and  cms  similarly  urged  dhs-ice to undertake and communicate the results of a comprehensive analysis of its  information systems, identifying the information it tracks on those subject to its custody;  how, when, and which officials collect, enter, and can access this information; its quality  control  procedures;  and  the  accessibility  of  this  information  to  congressional  oversight  committees, government watchdog agencies, and relevant ice officials.
(usccb-mrs  and cms 2015, 32).


this paper strongly supports the cfr and usccb-cms recommendations.
we further  recommend that dhs initiate a process to engage congress, other federal agencies, states,  scholars, researchers, and ngos on the information and data it should collect related to  its immigration enforcement responsibilities, including detention.


as part of this process,  congress and dhs should determine which data it can and should make publicly available  for the purposes of transparency, accountability, and more thorough analysis of the removal  and detention systems.
we also strongly recommend that dhs-ice provide public access to its earm and eabd  information  manual  and  that  it  produce  quarterly  data  on  all  those  held  in  its  custody,  including as many fields of data as it can provide consistent with privacy concerns.


dhs  should allow scholars, researchers and ngos to serve as a force-multiplier whose work  can help to inform policy development, oversight, and operational strategies.
the paper  also proposes more exhaustive annual reporting on the removal and detention system.


dhs-ice should also collect complete and accurate data.
the september 22, 2012 dataset,  for  example,  lacks  information  on  whether  a  final  removal  order  has  been  received  in  2,053 cases.


it would be impossible without this information for dhs-ice to know when  detainees become eligible for release, particularly in post-removal order cases.
31 dhs-ice  should work with the immigration courts and detainee states of origin to prevent prolonged  and  indefinite  detention  in  all  cases.


the  cms  analysis  found  553  detainees  who  had  been continuously in custody for more than six months after receiving a removal order  in apparent violation of the zadvydas and clark decisions on prolonged detention.
it also  found that persons in removal proceedings were not invariably detained for brief periods  as the supreme court assumed in demore v.


kim; 2,257 persons with pending removal  cases had been detained for six months or longer on september 22, 2012.
31   dhs-ice may have other information sources that allow it to track potential eligibility for release.


351  piecing together the us immigrant detention puzzlethe expanded use of alternative-to-detention programs has been a consistent goal of dhs- ices administrative detention reform initiative.
this analysis supports far greater use of  atds.


on the one hand, it revealed that 4,386 detainees on september 22, 2012 had been  in custody for a week or less.
on the other, it found that 8,785 persons had been detained  for more than three months.


the need for atd programs would, of course, be far greater  and their use more appropriate in the latter cases.
the analysis also found a substantial increase from january 25, 2009 to september 22, 2012  in the percentage of detainees with criminal convictions, from 42 to 61 percent.


however,  only 16 percent of detainees with criminal convictions on september 22, 2012 had been  convicted of a violent crime.
overall, more than 90 percent of detainees on september 22,  2012 had no criminal record or had been convicted of a non-violent crime, factors that  should mitigate in favor of their eligibility for atd programs.


finally, the analysis demonstrates the increased privatization of the immigrant detention  system.
as a growing body of literature suggests, the privatization of immigrant detention  may represent the greatest barrier to detention reform and to a transparent, accountable, and  more humane system (usccb-mrs and cms 2015, 184-186; nijc 2015, 5).


because  detention  implicates  fundamental  liberty  interests  and  core  human  and  civil  rights,  the  government should bear full responsibility for administering this system.
for-profit prison  agencies  which invariably seek to expand their business opportunities and to maximize  their profits  should have at most a modest, supportive role in the immigrant detention  system (usccb-mrs and cms 2015, 192).
