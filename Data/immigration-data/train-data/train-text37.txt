childrens migration to the  united states from mexico and  central america:  evidence from  the mexican and latin american  migration projects1  katharine m.
donato vanderbilt university  blake sisk vanderbilt university  executive summary in  light  of  rising  numbers  of  unaccompanied  minors  at  the  mexico- us  border  in  2014,  this  article  examines  child  migration  from  mexico,  guatemala,  el  salvador,  costa  rica,  and  nicaragua.


using  data  from  the  mexican  and  latin  american  migration  projects  that  permit  us  to  go beyond simple descriptive analysis about children apprehended at the  border, we investigate the extent to which children from these countries:  (1) enter without legal authorization to do so; (2) are more likely to cross  the border now than in the past; and (3) are tied to their parents migration.
in theory, if immigration and refugee protections worked well for children  and offered them legal pathways to reunify with their families, then we  would expect low levels of unauthorized entry and no dramatic shifts over  time.


however, our examination of child migration shows that it is strongly  linked to unauthorized entry, period of entry, and parents us experience.
the findings show that the migration of children is closely linked to their  parents migration history.


although the overall likelihood of a mexican  child  making  a  first  us  trip  is  quite  low,  it  is  practically  non-existent  for children whose parents have no us experience.
thus, the increase in  child migration from central america, and the continued high levels of  child migration from mexico result from widespread migration networks  and  the  united  states  long-standing  reliance  on  the  childrens  parents  as  immigrant  workers.


the  findings  suggest  that  these  children  need  protection in the form of family reunification and permanent legal status.

jmhs volume 3 number 1 (2015): 58-79introduction in 2014, the number of unaccompanied children detained at the mexico-us border for  attempting to cross without legal documents rose dramatically to almost 68,000.
the us  customs and border protection (cbp) reported a surge in the number of children (up to  17 years of age) from el salvador, guatemala, and honduras from approximately 1,000  per nation in 2009 to between 16,000 and 18,000 per nation in 2014, and high numbers  from mexico (averaging close to 15,000 per year) (cbp 2014).


in prior fiscal years, total  apprehensions  of  unaccompanied  children  increased  from  16,067  in  2011  to  24,481  in  2012 and 38,833 in 2013 (chishti and hipsman 2014).
media coverage of the 2014 surge  was extensive.


caldwell (2014a) and others described thousands of children as alone  without parents or other relatives.
photographs showed young children with fearful faces  from behind iron bars in sterile institutional settings, and reports described them as being  scared, hungry, and tired (caldwell 2014b).


in light of rising numbers of unaccompanied minors at the mexico-us border, we examine  child migration from mexico, guatemala, el salvador, costa rica, and nicaragua.
using  data from the mexican and latin american migration projects2 that permit us to go beyond  simple  descriptive  analysis  about  children  apprehended  at  the  border,  we  consider  the  extent to which children from these countries: (1) enter without legal authorization to do  so; (2) are more likely to cross the border now than in the past; and (3) are tied to their  parents migration.


when attempting to understand childrens growing presence at the border, many cite the  difficult and dangerous conditions that children face in mexico and countries in central  america  including  high  levels  of  violence  and  poverty.
such  explanations  imply  that  children are rational actors who, like many international migrants, calculate the costs and  benefits of migrating versus staying at home.


evidence from our analysis offers a correction  to such narratives by underscoring that childrens migration is strongly linked to that of  their parents.
unlike other children who face similarly difficult (or worse) conditions in  everyday life around the world, children from mexico and central america have access to  migrant human capital in the form of their parents us experience.


therefore, rather than  viewing them as independent, rational actors who, on their own, decide to leave dangerous  conditions  and/or  limited  economic  opportunities  in  their  homelands,  we  suggest  that  many children are migrating together with their parents or based on information and other  resources related to parents migration experiences.
violence and poverty are structural  conditions that underlie migration decisions, but on their own, they do not predict child  migration.


2  the mexican migration project (mmp) gathers data from households and communities about  mexico-us migration.
created in 1982, data are collected from new households and communities  each year and added to the dataset.


all data are available to the public (mmp.
opr.


princeton.
edu).


each household sample represents households in that community in a given year.
in addition, each  communitys household sample is supplemented by a small number of interviews with migrants  who left their community of origin to permanently migrate to the united states.


the latin american  migration project (lamp) is an extension of the mmp.
lamp data have been collected in many  countries in central and south america, including colombia, costa rica, the dominican republic,  ecuador, el salvador, guatemala, haiti, nicaragua, paraguay, and peru (lamp.

unfortunately, honduras is not included in the dataset.


59  childrens migration to the united states from mexico and central americaif most unaccompanied child migrants have parents or other relatives in the united states,  they should be eligible for protections under a comprehensive immigration system that  safeguards  the  rights  and  outcomes  of  children.
yet,  recent  reports  document  cases  of  unaccompanied minors that have been issued deportation orders upon arrival in the united  states even though their parents are residing in the country legally with temporary protected  status  (sacchetti  2014).


3  unfortunately,  this  treatment  occurs  because  contemporary  immigration policy has been driven largely by security and enforcement since the 1990s,  and  especially  after  september  11,  2001  (massey,  durand,  and  malone  2002;  kerwin  2012).
in theory, if immigration and refugee protections worked well for children and offered  them legal pathways to reunify with their families, then we would expect low levels of  unauthorized entry and no dramatic shifts over time.


however, our examination of child  migration from mexico and four central american nations shows that it is strongly linked  to  unauthorized  entry.
in  addition,  for  children  from  mexico,  we  see  that,  net  of  other  factors, their lifetime chances to migrate without authorization are substantially higher if  their parents are migrants and these chances fluctuate considerably across recent periods.


children in the process of migration the world bank (2006) estimated that young people, defined as those between 12 and 24  years of age, make up one-third of all international migrants, and as a consequence, migrant  youth have become a major economic development issue.
for mexican immigrants in the  united states, the share of youth is lower but still substantial: approximately 14 percent of  all mexican immigrants are aged 19 or below (gans 2009).


this suggests that a sizeable  number of mexicans who migrated to the united states did so when they were children  (ibid.
).


moreover, using ipums-international data from 11 censuses, mckenzie (2008)  shows that the migration of youth was largely tied to that of their parents; children often  migrated with parents or made trips to join their parent in host societies.
4 since the 1990s, scholars have begun to focus on children in the migration process.


some  have examined the consequences of us migration for children (kanaiaupuni and donato  1999a,  1999b;  donato,  kanaiaupuni,  and  stainback  2003;  menjvar  and abrego  2009;  donato  and  duncan  2011;  nobles  2011;  dreby  2010,  2012; adsera  and tienda  2012).
others have analyzed the experiences of the children of global immigrants (portes and  3  temporary protected status (tps), a program created by the immigration act of 1990, offers  safe haven to persons from designated countries to which it would be unsafe to return due to armed  conflict, natural disaster, or other extraordinary and temporary conditions and who do meet the  legal definition of a refugee.


tps recipients receive work authorization but lack a path to permanent  legal status, are ineligible for resettlement assistance and most federal public benefits, and cannot  petition for admission of immediate family members to the united states.
tps is not extended  to persons from designated countries that arrive to the united states after the effective date of  the designation, nor is it available to persons in need of safe haven from non-designated states  (bergeron 2014).


4  mckenzie also reports that 42 percent of young us migrants were female.
among migrant youth  aged 12-14, many attend school.


in the united states, for example, 97 percent of youth migrants  from india and china, and 85 percent from mexico and el salvador, were enrolled in school.
60  journal on migration and human securityrumbaut 2001; farley and alba 2002; portes, fernandez-kelly, and haller 2005; kasinitz  et  al.


2010;  mazzucato  and  schans  2011;  bledsoe  and  sow  2011;  graham  and  jordan  2011; lee and zhou 2014).
finally, recent scholarship has examined the experiences of  unauthorized latino immigrant youth in the united states, especially as they transition  into adulthood (abrego and gonzales 2010; gonzales 2011; abrego 2013; enriquez 2014).


yet exactly how children are involved in border crossing is less well understood.
in the  mexico-us case, studies describe an intergenerational process whereby migration has been  passed down from one generation to the next, especially from fathers to sons (reichert and  massey 1979; massey et al.


1987; massey and liang 1989).
other studies refer to child  migration but they do not explicitly target their movement as a focus for study.


for example,  when describing the pre-1965 and post-1965 phases of mexico-us migration, reichert and  massey (1979, 1980) report only that many women and children migrated to join former  agricultural workers who had become legal us immigrants.
theoretically speaking, stark  (1991) and others imply that children are involved in the migration process in arguing  that  householdsand  not  individualsmake  migration  decisions  which  seek  to  diversify  household risks and costs.


relatedly, women and children enter the migration process as  it unfolds over the lives of mexican communities and households (massey, goldring, and  durand 1994); when mexican communities first participate in out-migration, they usually  send mostly young single men who cross without documentation for us farm or other  unskilled jobs.
over time, however, as migration streams mature, many women and children  accompany male family members from mexican communities (reichert and massey 1980;  fonseca and moreno 1988; goldring 1990; durand and massey 1992; donato 1993, 1994;  cerrutti and massey 2001; donato, wagner, and patterson 2008; creighton and riosmena  2013).


in contrast, tucker and colleagues (2013) explicitly consider how mexican youth, aged 14- 24, make migration decisions using data from semi-structured interviews.
like many adults  migrating northward, youth with prior us experience reported that economic hardship and  difficulty finding a job were their main reasons for migrating.


furthermore, their decision  to migrate depended on their parents because most migrant children accompanied their  parents.
however,  among  those  interviewed  who  had  never  migrated,  adolescents  and  young adults wanted to remain in mexico.


these youth had no plans to migrate because  they could envision economic opportunities for themselves in mexico and because they  feared the difficulties they would face crossing the border and living in the united states  without authorization.
therefore, although studies point to children and young adults in the mexico-us migration  process, most do not focus on childrens experiences per se.


furthermore, it is unclear the  extent to which children migrate with their parents.
if it is true that children have fueled  mexico-us migration for decades, then understanding how, when, and with whom they  move is important to understanding childrens movement from nations in central america.


moreover, even if parents are an important trigger of childrens migration, studies have  yet to empirically examine how childrens migration prospects vary by different periods of  entry and legal statusan important task given the emphasis on security and enforcement  in us immigration policy since september 11, 2001 (kerwin 2012).
61  childrens migration to the united states from mexico and central americapush and pull factors no agreement exists about the push and pull factors that underlie the recent rise in the number  of child arrivals in the united states (chishti and hipsman 2014; kandel et al.


2014).
yet,  although the precise combination of motives behind the rising numbers of child migrants  is  not  clear,  three  conditionslimited  economic  and  educational  opportunities,  family  reunification,  and  recent  us  immigration  policiesare  certainly  implicated  (kandel  et  al.


2014, 12).
so is the violence that children face, especially in some central american  countries.


for example, honduras, el salvador, and guatemala are among the top five  nations  with  the  highest  murder  rates,  and  they  are  also  known  for  having  smugglers  that recruit young children to migrate (kennedy 2014).
these and other conditions were  described by children who entered the united states after 2011, and who were interviewed  by the united nations high commissioner for refugees (unhcr) regional office for the  united states and the caribbean.


they gave protection-related reasons for migrating which  suggest that most children in el salvador, guatemala, honduras, and mexico may well be  in need of international protection (unhcr 2014, 6).
in  addition  to  personally  threatening  conditions,  children  in  these  nations  face  limited  economic and social mobility.


for example, in mexico, which is considerably wealthier  than  other  nations  in  central  america,  student  performance  in  schools  remains  well  behind that of other organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd)  countries, despite the governments sizable investments in mexicos educational system  since  the  1990s  (acevedo  and  salinas  2000).
in  2012,  mexico  had  one  of  the  highest  rates of preschool enrollment but its effectiveness was challenged by high student-teacher  ratios (oecd 2012).


in addition, although mexico expanded compulsory attendance to the  secondary level in 1993, secondary school graduation rates remain very low.
complicating the story is an enforcement-first us immigration policy regime that has made  conditions difficult for all immigrants (meissner et al.


2013; aranda, menjivar, and donato  2014;  donato  and  sisk  2013).
as  a  consequence,  more  unauthorized  immigrants  have  settled rather than returned home after working temporarily in the united states (massey,  durand, and malone 2002).


with enforcement spending much larger than it was in 1986  and billions spent on cbp and immigration and customs enforcement each year (meissner  et al.
2013), immigrant families have lived in a context of pervasive fear and anxiety since  the mid-1990s (rodriguez and hagan 2004).


more deportations have created family trauma  (hagan, castro, and rodriguez 2009; hagan, eschbach and rodriguez 2008; hagan et al.
2003), which is especially injurious for children (dreby 2012).


5  not  surprisingly,  these  structural  conditions  drive  the  desire  for  family  reunification  (kandel  et  al.
2014,  15).


however,  children  are  migrating  temporarily  because  many  who reside in mexico, el salvador, guatemala, and honduras have ties to parents in the  united states.
unhcr  (2014)  reports  that 22,  49,  27,  and  47  percent, respectively,  of  unaccompanied children entering the united states from these four countries since 2011  had at least one parent living in the united states.


some central american parents residing  in the united states, such as el salvadorans, hondurans, and nicaraguans, have temporary  protected status, but it cannot be extended to their children or other beneficiaries without  5  studies  also  describe  a  wide  range  of  other  consequences  (see  garcia  2010; armenta  2012;  donato and rodriguez 2014).
62  journal on migration and human securityus senate support (kerwin 2014; bergeron 2014).


at  the  center  of  public  debates  about  the  rising  numbers  of  unaccompanied  minors  at  the us border are provisions of the william wilberforce trafficking victims protection  reauthorization act (tvpra) of 2008.
it guides the treatment of minors being apprehended  at  the  border,  and  mandates  that  only  those  from  contiguous  countriesmexico  and  canadamay  be  quickly  processed  and  deported.


6  children  from  non-contiguous  countries, such as those in central america, are placed in formal removal proceedings and,  after processing, are released to parents or other relatives who will care for them as they  wait to appear in front of an immigration judge as part of formal removal proceedings.
as a result of immigration court backlogs, however, unaccompanied minors apprehended  during the summer of 2014 were given a waiting period of approximately two years for  their court dates.


chishti and hipsman (2014) suggest that long-waiting periods, as well  as the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program, have helped to create a  perception among many potential migrants that the united states treatment of minors has  softened in recent years and the false idea that the children entering now could receive  legal status.
thus, more children may be attempting to enter because they believe they will  ultimately receive permission to remain permanently in the united states.


data and methods given this backdrop, we analyze data about child migration from the mexican and latin  american migration projects (mmp and lamp).
although they cover periods when child  migration from central america represented a small share of overall child migration, these  data offer three important advantages.


first, they give us an opportunity to go beyond simple  descriptive results, such as those using us customs and border patrol data to describe  recent patterns and shifts in unaccompanied minor apprehensions at the southwest border.
second,  mmp  and  lamp  data  tell  us  about  all  children  who  migrate  rather  than  only  unaccompanied minors apprehended at the mexico-us border.


and third, the data permit  us to consider whether there are social protections that work for children; if they exist and  work well, then we would expect low levels of unauthorized entry and no dramatic shifts  over time.
7  using detailed information on the social and demographic characteristics of children and  their parents from the mmp and lamp, we consider how many children make a first us  trip,  where  they  come  from,  and  the  extent  to  which  their  crossing  is  linked  to  family  reunification, unauthorized status, and particular periods of entry.


in addition, we use the  larger mmp sample to examine how childrens propensities to migrate vary by: (1) parents  migration histories; (2) childrens period of entry; and (3) legal status, controlling for the  effects of other factors.
using life table analysis, we also show how childrens cumulative   6  minors entering from mexico and canada are summarily deported only if screening results show  they are not trafficking victims or have asylum claims based on a credible fear of persecution or  torture.


7  the lamp and mmp data reported here were not designed specifically to examine the migration  experiences of children; however, the survey design allows us to investigate some elements of child  migration, especially how it relates to parents experiences and legal status.
63  childrens migration to the united states from mexico and central americamigration chances (up through age 17) vary by these three characteristics.


the analysis is divided into two sections, the first of which is a descriptive analysis of mmp  and lamp data.
for the descriptive analysis, we illustrate the extent that children from  four central american countries and mexico make a first us trip.


to make the descriptive  analysis  comparable  across  countries,  we  use  surveys  conducted  from  2000-2013.
we  use all lamp countries in central america (nicaragua, costa rica, guatemala, and el  salvador);8 these data include 23 communities and, within each, 4,112 randomly chosen  households.


9 for mexico, we use mmp data from 71 communities and 10,723 randomly  chosen  households.
for  all  countries,  the  analysis  is  limited  to  respondents  residing  in  households where they are categorized as a child of the head of household and are 40 years  of age or younger at the time of the survey.


10 with these sample restrictions, we create a  sample of mexicans and central americans who migrated to the us as minors between  1977 and 2013, with information about the legal status of those trips and migration history  of their parents.
11  the second section is a multivariate analysis of mmp data.


because mmp data represent  many more respondents than the lamp, the second half of the analysis uses multivariate  regression and life table techniques to examine how childrens migration from mexico  varies by parents migration, legal status, and period of entry, net of other factors.
this  analysis is restricted to children residing in two-parent households and to those with at  least one biological parent in the household.


12 the mmps larger sample of communities  reflects the projects longer history (since the mid-1980s) and includes an economically  and geographically diverse set of sending communities.
unlike the descriptive analysis,  the larger sample size allows us to limit the multivariate analysis only to respondents who  are aged 17 or younger at the time of the survey.


we also use data from surveys conducted  from 1987 to 2013.
given each childs date of birth and the year of the survey, we construct a year-by-year  life history up to the date of the childs first us trip.


13 the outcome measure is whether the   8  unfortunately, honduras is not included in the lamp dataset.
9  we use data from 9 communities and 1,789 households in nicaragua, 7 communities and 1,428  households in costa rica, 3 communities and 513 households in guatemala, and 4 communities  and 382 households in el salvador.


10  although it may be preferable to restrict the analysis only to respondents who are minors at the  time of the survey, we are unable to do so because of the small sample size of respondents who  migrated as children in the lamp data.
11 the  majority  were  interviewed  in  mexico  or  central american  origin  communities;  the  us  samples accounted for less than two percent of our total sample.


12  in a separate analysis, we added children from one-parent households to those from two-parent  households and re-estimated the multivariate models by including a 0,1 dummy variable to control  for children in one-parent households.
we also ran separate models by family structure.


although  children from one-parent households were slightly more likely to make a first us trip, the findings  reveal no substantive differences for children in two versus one-parent households in the coefficients  for predictors of a first us migrant trip (analysis available upon request).
thus we chose to display  results from the two-parent household analysis.


13  that is, we built a discrete-time person-year file that followed each child from birth to the date  of their nineteenth birthday or to the first us trip, whichever came first.
64  journal on migration and human securitychild migrated within the person-year in question.


if he/she did not migrate in a given year,  the migration variable is coded 0; if he/she migrated in that year, it is coded 1, and all later  years of life are excluded from the file.
in every year when migration occurred, we also  record legal status (authorized or unauthorized).


14  we regress the 0-1 migration variable on indicators representing legal status, childs period  of entry, parental migration history, gender, age, and type of origin community from which  the migration occurred.
childrens period of entry includes: before 1987, when mexico-us  migration was largely predictable and circular; 1987-96, immediately after passage of the  1986 immigration reform and control act (irca) which increased border enforcement  funds  and  offered  amnesty  to  approximately  three  million  previously  unauthorized  immigrants; and 1997-2011, a period after passage of the 1996 immigrant responsibility  and act which strengthened ircas enforcement provisions and set new standards that  criminalized immigrants.


this period also covers post-september 11, 2001, during which  immigration became a national security issue and the department of homeland security  was established.
we capture the migration history of both parents in the household relative  to children in three categories: either of the parents migrated in a year before the child  migrated; either of the parents migrated in the same year as the child migrated; and both  parents did not migrate (reference category).


finally, in addition to gender and age, we  include a measure of the metropolitan status of the community of origin (large metropolitan  status is the reference).
descriptive results table 1 presents three different sets of percentages to assess national origin differences in  child migration calculated from the lamp and mmp data.


panel a shows the percent of sons  and daughters who were 40 years or younger at the time of the survey and reported a first  us trip from surveyed households from mexico, nicaragua, costa rica, guatemala, and  el salvador.
approximately 10 percent from mexico had migration experience, compared  to 4.


7 percent for those from nicaragua, 5.
8 percent from costa rica, 8.


1 percent from  guatemala, and 14.
3 percent from el salvador.


that most percentages were significantly  lower than mexicos is worth noting, except for el salvador; its percentage well exceeds  mexicos.
similar national origin differences appear in panel b, which presents the percentages of all  sons and daughters who made a migrant trip as a minor by national origin.


although overall  percentages are smaller because of the additional restriction that migrants crossed at ages  younger than age 18, rates remained higher for mexicans than for nicaraguans and costa  ricans (3.
4 versus 2.


2 and 2.
2, respectively).


moreover, although rates did not significantly  differ between guatemalans and mexicans, el salvadorans reported a significantly higher  share of sons and daughters who made first trips as minors (5.
3 percent).


14  legal (or authorized) child migrants had valid us documents to enter and reside in the united  states; unauthorized migrants did not.

panel  c  switches  the  focus  somewhat  by  presenting  the  shares  of  migrant  sons  and  daughters who were 40 years or younger at the time of the survey and made that trip as a  minor (younger than 18 years of age) by country.


approximately one-third (34.
1 percent)  of mexican migrants made their first trip as a minor.


moreover, although rates of first minor  trips from costa rica, guatemala, and el salvador were comparable to those for migrants  from mexico, significantly more migrants from nicaragua (46 percent) than mexico made  a first trip as a minor.
because differences in table 1 likely reflect other characteristics about immigrants from  these five countries, table 2 offers us more detail about the minor sons and daughters who  made first us trips.


the table features critical information regarding minor migrants: legal  status, period of entry, and parents migration experience.
among those from mexico, for  example, fully 81 percent were unauthorized on their first trip, with 1994 as their average  year of entry, 42 percent made the initial trip after 1996, and slightly more than half (52.


6  percent) had at least one parent with us migration experience.
compared to mexicans,  nicaraguans, costa ricans, and guatemalans were less likely to be unauthorized but the  percentage for el salvadorans was comparable to that for mexicans.


the average year of  first trip was earlier for both nicaraguans and el salvadorans (1988 and 1990), but only  nicaraguans differed significantly from mexicans in that a smaller share made a first trip  after 1996.
among minor migrants from other countries, including mexico, approximately  40 percent made their first trips after 1996.


with respect to parental migration, the shares   66  journal on migration and human securityof child migrants from nicaragua and costa rica with migrant parents were higher than for  mexico, but significantly lower for those from guatemala and no different for those from  el salvador.

1  percent  of  respondents  whose  parents  had  no  history  of  migrating took a us trip as a minor; by comparison, 7.


6 of respondents whose parents did  have us experience migrated as a minor.
among those from nicaragua, the gap between  minor children with and without migrant parents was much bigger.


although approximately  one percent of respondents with parents with no us experience made a first us trip as a  minor, 16 percent of those who had migrant parents did so.
parents migration history also  increased the possibility that minor children from costa rica and el salvador would make  a first us trip, although it had no effect for those from guatemala.


the bottom panel of figure 1 reveals that parents history differentiates the unauthorized  migration chances of minor children from mexico, nicaragua, and costa rica.
for example,  of all sons and daughters from mexican households aged 40 years or younger at the time  of the survey and who made their first trip as a minor, approximately two percent migrated  as minors on an unauthorized trip if their parents had no migration experience compared to  more than twice that share (5.


5 percent) for those with parents with migration experience.
parental  migration  history  also  significantly  differentiated  the  shares  of  unauthorized  migration of minor children from nicaragua and costa rica, although levels for the latter  were very small.

first,  parental  migration  affects  childrens  migration.
whether  we  consider all child migrants or only those making a first unauthorized us trip, their ties to  parents with prior or current migration history translate into significantly more migration.


the gaps are especially large for nicaragua, el salvador, and mexico (in that order) among  those making a trip as a minor child.
for those minors making an unauthorized trip, the gap  between children with and without parental migration is statistically significant and notably  different only for nicaragua and mexico.


given that the overall percentages of respondents  who reported having migrated as children are relatively low and range from only two to  five percent across countries (see panel b of table 2), the results in figure 1 indicate that  for mexico, nicaragua, and el salvador, there is a strong link between parental migration  and the likelihood that a minor child will migrate to the united states.
to examine whether these differences hold net of other factors, table 3 presents regression  models that predict whether or not a child makes a first us trip up through age 17.


the  first set of columns refers to all first trips, whereas the next two sets of columns refer to  authorized and unauthorized trips.
results for all first trips suggest that the likelihood of  migrating varies by childrens period of entry.


among those entering in the 1987-96 period,  the likelihood of migrating is higher than in the pre-1987 period.
this finding suggests that  childrens migration was linked to ircas amnesty program, although children were far  less likely than their parents especially fathers (donato 1993)to regularize their status  during this period.


by comparison, childrens likelihood of making a first trip drops in  1997-2011, which reflects growing restrictions on all immigrants during this time.
coefficients for parents migration experience clearly show that it is linked to childrens  migration.


compared to children whose parents had no us experience, those with migrant  parents  (either  in  the  past  or  present)  were  much  more  likely  to  make  a  first  us  trip.
girls were much less likely than boys to migrate, and older children were more likely  than younger ones to migrate.


community type also matters; compared to children from  metropolitan areas, the likelihood of children migrating was higher in small urban areas  and isolated ranchos in rural areas.
comparison of the next two sets of models reveals a very different process of first-trip  migration  for  children  making  authorized  versus  unauthorized  trips.


yet  there  is  one  exception: it refers to effects for parents migration history.
whether we consider childrens  authorized or unauthorized first trips, children are much more likely to migrate in the year  their parents migrate, and they are also more likely to migrate if their parents migrated in  the past, relative to children whose parents have never migrated.


however, differences in time period are much larger for childrens making unauthorized  first us trips.
similar to the model for all trips, the likelihood of making a first unauthorized  trip is highest during the amnesty period, relative to the pre-1987 period.


the likelihood  turns negative in 1997-2011.
among children making their first authorized trip, the only  effect is negative and marginally significant (at p< .


10) for the 1997-2011 period.
among  the  remaining  effects,  gender  matters  for  childrens  unauthorized  first  trips  but  not  for  authorized  ones.


girls  were  significantly  less  likely  than  boys  to  make  a  first  unauthorized trip.
age effects were also different across the two models.

in addition, among  children  crossing  without  authorization,  those  aged  12-13  were  also  significantly  more  likely to make a first us trip.


finally, compared to large metropolitan areas, children from  small urban areas, towns, and rural ranchos were more likely to make a first unauthorized  trip.

these probabilities were  calculated from coefficients in the unauthorized model in table 3.
figure 2 shows that,  while the chances that children make an unauthorized trip are low, childrens migration  is clearly tied to their parents.


net of other factors, the chances that children make a first  unauthorized trip are higher for those whose parents crossed in the same year.
in addition,  the chances were highest in 1987-96, followed by the 1970-86 period, and lowest in 1997- 2011.


to make the results of this analysis even more tangible, we used the model coefficients in  table 3 to generate predicted probabilities of children making a first legal and unauthorized  trip and from these probabilities, we derived a set of life tables to compute the cumulative  probability  of  childrens  legal  and  unauthorized  migration  by  age  17.

398  note: results generated from regression models in table 3.


these results show what would happen if a child born in mexico were to go through their  seventeenth year of life subject to the rates of out-migration prevailing in different years.
overall,  irrespective  of  legal  status,  there  are  two  noteworthy  findings.


first,  children   72  journal on migration and human securitywith parents migrating in the same year have much higher chances of making a first trip  than children with parents who never migrated or those whose parents migrated earlier.
the chance that a child makes a first us trip if his/her parents have no us experience  ranges  between  1  and  2  percent  across  the  three  periods  of  entry,  but  for  those  whose  parents migrated in the same year, the chances are considerably higher (.


692, .
755, and  .


555 across the three periods).
second, the chances that children, by age 17, make a first  trip are consistently higher for the 1987-96 period, when ircas amnesty program was  implemented, but only for unauthorized trips.


for example, the probability that a young  child would make a first unauthorized us trip during the year his/her parent migrated was  .
537 in 1970-86, grew to .


621 during the period when many mexicans received amnesty,  and then dropped to .
398 in 1997-2011.


these results, when taken together, indicate that the  overall likelihood of child migration from mexico has substantially decreased for children  with and without parents with us experience.
moreover, childrens lifetime chances of  making a first unauthorized trip shift across different periods of entry.


discussion although the data we examine here do not include the child migrants who arrived at the  us-mexico  border  in  2014,  they  do  offer  some  insight  into  the  mechanisms  by  which  individuals  migrate  as  minors.
in  particular,  our  findings  indicate  that  the  migration  of  children is closely linked to that of parents, and that a minor child is significantly more  likely to go on a first us trip if their parent has us migration experience.


rather than  supporting the hypothesis that child migrants are independent rational actors, this finding  lends support to the idea that child migrants are incorporated into the migration process via  their ties to families.
our analysis of child migration from mexico, in particular, highlights the interconnections  of migration between parents and children.


although the overall likelihood of a mexican  child making a first us trip is quite low, it is practically non-existent for children whose  parents  have  no  us  experience  and  it  increases  significantly  for  children  with  migrant  parents.
furthermore, while annual rates of mexico-us immigration have declined over the  past decade (passel, cohn, and gonzalez-barrera 2012), the central american immigrant  population has grown rapidly (stoney and batalova 2013).


15 these trends suggest continued  growth of central american immigration in the future, which implies that the linkages  between migrant parents and their children in communities of origin will continue to be  a part of the central american migration landscape for years to come (see also massey,  durand, and pren 2014).
thus, we recommend that discussions of childrens migration  should be rooted in a larger discussion about the opportunities that these minors have for  family reunification and access to legal immigration.


15  between  2000  and  2010,  central  american  immigrants  grew  faster  than  any  other  latin  american region.
in the last three decades, the numbers of central american immigrants have  nearly tripled from 1.


1 million to more than 3 million (stoney and batalova 2013).
during the  2000s, after mexico, the top national origins for unauthorized immigrants in the united states are  el salvador, guatemala, and honduras, and this population grew faster than that from mexico  (hoefer, rytina, and baker 2012).


finally, immigrants from central american nations have been  the primary recipients of temporary protected status (wasem and ester 2010).
73  childrens migration to the united states from mexico and central americaas  migrant  human  capital  has  grown  in  recent  decades  between  the  united  states  and  central america, congress  has been unable to pass  comprehensive immigration policy  reform.


the existing policy regime has significant shortcomings, especially with respect  to  protections  for  child  migrants  and  family  reunification.
therefore,  the  number  of  unaccompanied  minors  recently  apprehended  at  the  border  should  not  be  surprising.


although the structural conditions leading to out-migration are related to high levels of  poverty, violence in communities of origin, and smugglers who promote migration among  children, the rising number of children from central america and mexico is related to  widespread  migration  networks  and  a  long-standing  reliance  on  immigrant  workers  in  the united states.
it is time to recognize that these children need protections in the form  of permanent legal status to reunify with their families.


if the united states cannot pass  comprehensive  immigration  reform,  at  minimum  it  should  provide  for  the  children  of  immigrants it readily employs.
