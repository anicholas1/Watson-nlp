the us labor standards 
enforcement system and 
low-wage immigrants: 
recommendations for legislative 
and administrative reform

executive summary
low-wage  immigrants  in  the  united  states,  particularly  the  8  million 
unauthorized workers, suffer from widespread labor standards violations.  
their  protection  represents  a  singular  challenge  for  modestly-resourced 
federal and state regulators, particularly in an era of record immigration 
enforcement.  many  employers  hire  the  unauthorized,  knowingly  or 
unknowingly, because they cannot attract sufficient numbers of authorized 
workers. an enduring minority, however, prefer to employ unauthorized 
workers in order to suppress wages and working conditions and to gain an 
advantage over their competitors. their business model depends on the 
exploitation of workers who are less likely to complain, organize or pursue 
other remedies for mistreatment. exacerbating matters, the unauthorized 
work disproportionately in jobs to which certain labor standards do not 
apply, and they belong to labor unions at lower rates than the us workforce 
as a whole (schmitt 2010). employers, in turn, face intense competition and 
pressure to cut costs.  in addition, intensive immigration enforcement can 
make employees more vulnerable to retaliation for exercising their rights 
and less likely to challenge abuses (cho and smith 2013).
this paper analyzes labor standards enforcement in light of the challenges 
posed by bad-faith employers, the historically high population of low-wage 
immigrant laborers (particularly the unauthorized), and record spending 
on immigration enforcement. it draws from a comprehensive report titled 
labor  standards  enforcement  and  low-wage  immigrants:  creating  an 
effective  enforcement  system  (kerwin  and  mccabe  2011).  the  paper 
identifies gaps in protection in the legal and regulatory labor standards 
framework, with a particular focus on the us department of labors (dols) 
wage and hour division (whd) which enforces the fair labor standards

act (flsa).1 it argues that labor standards should be strengthened and 
enforcement resources bolstered. however, it also recognizes that federal 
and state agencies will never be able to investigate, penalize, or monitor 
a significant share of the employers subject to their jurisdictions. thus, 
it  concludes  that  the  overall  goal  of  these  agencies  should  be  to  deter 
violations and to maximize compliance with the law.
to achieve these goals, regulators must be able to identify industries, sectors 
and  firms  with  vulnerable  workers;  map  the  structures,  relationships, 
and  the  distinct  incentives  of  employers  within  these  industries;  and 
continuously  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  their  enforcement  strategies. 
whd, in particular, needs to establish robust partnerships with other federal 
and state enforcement agencies, as well as with businesses, labor unions, 
and  community-based  organizations  (cbos)  that  enjoy  direct  access  to 
low-wage immigrant workers. status-blind enforcement and a coordinated 
response to the misclassification of employees as independent contractors 
must also be key priorities. in addition, a large-scale legalization program 
would strengthen the ability of immigrant workers to exercise and defend 
their rights. 

the legal and regulatory framework 

federal standards and enforcement resources

whd has responsibility for enforcing core federal labor laws, which include the flsa, 
migrant and seasonal agricultural worker protection act (mspa), family and medical 
leave act (fmla), davis bacon and related acts (dbra), and certain temporary worker 
programs. these laws cover more than 135 million private, state, and local government 
workers in more than 7.3 million business establishments (us dol 2011). yet despite the 
scope of its responsibilities and staffing increases in recent years, whd still employs only 
about 1,100 investigators (us dol 2013).  
the  flsa  sets  standards  for  national  minimum  wage,  overtime  pay,  recordkeeping, 
and  child  labor.2  it  exempts  certain  domestic  workers,  farmworkers,  and  seasonal  and 
recreational  workers  from  its  minimum  wage  and  overtime  requirements,  as  well  as 
additional workers from its overtime rules.3 in general, the flsa allows children to work 
at younger ages in agricultural than in other jobs.4 the flsas remedies for minimum 
wage and overtime violations include back pay, liquidated damages equal to the wages 
owed, and civil monetary penalties.5 repeated or willful violations of minimum wage and 
overtime  requirements  carry  fines  up  to  $1,100  per  violation.6 the  penalties  for  illegal 
termination or discrimination against employees who bring complaints or who institute 
suits over flsa violations include reinstatement, promotion, payment of lost wages, and

up to $10,000 and imprisonment of up to six months.8 us dol can also seek to restrain 
the transport, delivery, and sale of hot goods, which are goods produced in violation of 
the law.9
many  commentators  contend  that  the  flsas  remedial  sanctions  and  penalties  do  not 
sufficiently  deter  violations  by  bad-faith  employers,  particularly  when  weighed  against 
the limited chances of being caught or, if caught, of having to pay the full penalty assessed 
(smith  and  ruckelshaus  2007).   an  analysis  of  whds  wage  and  hour  investigative 
support and reporting database (whisard) found that dol collected only 61 percent 
of the civil monetary penalties that it assessed between 1998 and 2008 (weil 2010, 14). 
others criticize whd and the dols office of the solicitor for failing to seek all penalties 
available under the law (just pay working group 2010, 10). in addition, the flsas two-
year statute of limitations for recovery of wages (three years in the case of willful violations) 
runs from the time of the employers failure to pay the proper wages and not from the filing 
of the complaint.10 as a result, investigative delays can threaten recovery of back wages 
and liquidated damages (kutz and meyer 2009, 22-23). 
the occupational safety and health act of 1970 (osh act) requires employers to comply 
with safety and health standards, warn of potential hazards, and provide appropriate safety 
equipment.11 osh act also allows workers to request workplace inspections and it protects 
them from discrimination for filing complaints or instituting legal actions.12 employers 
must address violations within a reasonable time and can be assessed financial penalties 
and criminal sanctions for violating the law.13 
osh act applies to businesses affecting interstate commerce,14 but it does not apply to 
domestic  workers.15  in  addition,  a  longstanding  rider  to  us  dols  appropriations  bill 
has  prohibited  enforcement  of  osh acts  safety  and  health  standards  against  farming 
operations that do not have labor camps and have ten or fewer employees. except on the 
basis of complaints, the rider also prohibits osh acts safety (not health) standards from 
being enforced against employers in an extensive list of low-hazard industries with ten 
or fewer employees (osha 2011).
osh  act  covers  an  estimated  114  million  workers  at  7.5  million  private  business 
establishments  and  200,000  construction  work  sites  (us  dol  2011).  like  whd,  the 
occupational  safety  and  health administration  (osha)  can  investigate  only  a  fraction 
of  the  employers  under  its  jurisdiction,  even  in  the  most  dangerous  industries  (smith 
and  ruckelshaus  2007,  587-588).  osha  has  also  been  criticized  for  levying  fines  that 
do not approximate what it would cost employers to comply with the law, thus creating

the  national  labor  relations  act  (nlra)  safeguards  the  right  to  self-organization, 
to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively  and to engage in 
other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or 
protection.16  the national labor relations board (nlrb), an independent government 
agency, administers the nlra. the nlrb investigates potential unfair labor practices and 
administers elections to determine whether groups of employees want union representation.    
the  nlra  does  not  cover  agricultural  workers,  certain  domestic  workers,  and  other 
categories of workers.17  the authors of the wagner act of 1935 (the original nlra) viewed 
agricultural workers as the hired hands of small family farmers and domestic workers 
as quasi-family members to their employers (human rights watch 2000, 247-250). as a 
result, they deemed these workers as ill-suited for coverage under a law designed to curb 
industrial strife and unrest. however, in the current era of large-scale corporate farming 
and expanded demand for in-home child and elder care, these assumptions may no longer 
be valid.
in 2002, the us government accountability office (gao) estimated that three-quarters 
of the civilian workforce enjoyed collective bargaining rights under federal, state, or local 
laws. this left an estimated 32 million workers without such rights, among them 10.2 million 
managers and supervisors; 8.5 million independent contractors; 6.9 million federal, state, 
and local employees; 5.5 million small-business employees; 532,000 domestic workers; 
and  357,000  agricultural  workers  (gao  2002,  10).  low-wage  immigrants,  including 
the unauthorized, work at high rates in jobs within these exempt categories (passel and 
cohn 2009, 32).18  overall, immigrants belong to labor unions at lower rates than the us 
workforce as a whole (schmitt 2010).
the  nlrb  can  order  an  employer  to  discontinue  an  unlawful  practice,  to  reinstate  an 
employee,  and  to  pay  back  wages  and  benefits.19  critics  argue  that  these  non-punitive 
sanctions  lack  the  teeth  to  deter  anti-organizing  efforts.  in  addition,  the  nlras  most 
substantial penalty, payment of back wages, is not available for unauthorized workers.20 
nor can the unauthorized be reinstated.  like whd and osha, nlrb staffing levels fell 
significantly between 2001 and 2008, but increased after 2009 (kerwin and mccabe 2011).

state enforcement
federal  law  undergirds  the  nations  system  of  labor  protection.  however,  some  states 
devote substantial resources to labor standards enforcement, possess extensive expertise 
in the area, and target industries and practices that are also federal priorities. many states 
have minimum wage or child labor laws that exceed federal standards and view themselves 
as the primary enforcer of claims under the law (lurie 2010, 10). some states cover 

16  29 usc  151-169.
17  29 usc  152(3).

workers.

us labor standards enforcementemployees and situations not protected by the flsa (2-3).  for example, there is no federal 
counterpart  to  state  wage  payment  or  payday  laws,  which  require  that  employees 
be  paid  on  regularly  scheduled  days  (6-7,  26-27).  in  addition,  many  state  enforcement 
agencies enjoy the authority to compel payment of back wages, liquidated damages, and 
civil monetary penalties (12-14). by contrast, whd must rely on the dol office of the 
solicitor to pursue cases in court.
in recent years, the role of state labor enforcement agencies has been highlighted in reports 
and surveys by the brennan center for justice (bernhardt, mcgrath, and defilippis 2007), 
policy matters ohio (schiller and decarlo 2010), the nelson a. rockefeller institute of 
government at the state university of new york (lurie 2010), and the migration policy 
institute (mpi) (kerwin and mccabe 2011).  
mpis report revealed a range of state funding and investigative staffing levels. states with 
laws that are stricter than or parallel to federal standards often devote substantial resources 
to enforcing these laws. by contrast, states with weaker (than federal) labor laws have little 
reason to enforce their laws and employees in these states typically seek redress under 
federal laws.21 according to whd, 17 states and the district of columbia have minimum 
wage rates higher than the federal rate, 24 have rates that equal the federal rate, four have 
lower rates, and five have not established a minimum wage requirement. thirty-two states 
and washington, dc, require premium pay for overtime work (lurie 2010, 3).
most states devote modest resources to labor standards enforcement. of the 13 respondents 
to mpis survey, two states reported that they did not enforce minimum wage or overtime 
laws.  the georgia department of labor reported enforcing only child labor standards, 
while the florida department of business and professional regulation enforces only child 
and farm labor standards.  the mississippi department of employment security reported 
that  it  provided  job  training  and  business  services,  but  did  not  enforce  labor  standards 
(mississippi  department  of  employment  security,  n.d.;  interstate  labor  standards 
association, n.d.).  georgia and texas provide little or no enforcement by any [state] 
agency but offer a private right of action for labor standards violations (lurie 2010, 4-6).
however, states collectively employ nearly as many investigators as whd (schiller and 
decarlo 2010, 4). the 43 respondents to the policy matters ohio survey employed 659.5 
labor  standards  investigators  (2-4). the  18  state  agencies  surveyed  by the  rockefeller 
institute employed 405 investigators (lurie 2010, 18). twenty-seven states also administer 
and enforce health and safety standards under plans approved and monitored by osha.  
the  safety  and  health  standards  of  state  plans  must  equal  or  exceed  osha  standards 
(osha, n.d.). in total, these states employ 1,331 investigators, the great majority of them 
safety investigators (kerwin and mccabe 2011, 55).
the brennan center studied 13 industry clusters in new york city. its report highlighted 
enforcement  challenges  even  in  a  community  with  comparatively  strong  labor  laws, 
established task forces devoted to particular industries and high union density (bernhardt, 
mcgrath,  and  defilippis  2007,  36). at  the  time,  roughly  100  of  the  new  york  labor 

21  some employees may only be able to seek redress under state laws as, for example, when a state statute 
of limitations for obtaining back wages (such as in florida) is longer than the federal statute of limitations
even though state minimum wage or other provisions are weaker than federal laws.  

36

journal on migration and human securityinvestigators  covered  approximately  500,000  workplaces  (32).  the  report  documented 
widespread  minimum  wage,  overtime,  osha,  and  workers  compensation  violations 
against unauthorized and authorized immigrants (36).
although certain workers (like the unauthorized) are less likely to file complaints than 
others, states overwhelmingly rely on complaints to initiate investigations (lurie 2010, 
8, 25). by way of contrast, california, new york, new jersey, and connecticut engage 
in proactive, strategic enforcement. in particular, they target industries with a history 
of  violations,  inspect  firms  within  targeted  industries,  conduct  sweeps  of  targeted 
neighborhoods  and  employers,  partner  with  community  groups,  and  participate  in  task 
forces devoted to particular industry sectors (9). 

lessons from past administrations
to be effective, a labor standards enforcement system should incorporate lessons learned 
from past enforcement programs and strategies. to that end, this section examines the distinct 
enforcement philosophies and strategies of the clinton, bush and obama administrations.  
under the clinton administration (1993 to 2001), whd attempted to shift its strategic focus 
away from complaint-based investigations and toward industries with the most pronounced 
compliance problems. complaint-based enforcement strategies do not adequately cover 
workers who feel vulnerable to exploitation (weil and pyles 2005, 91), including those 
without immigration status, union representation, knowledge of their rights, or job security 
(weil 2010, 76). whd reasoned that pursuing individual claims for wages that should have 
been paid in the first instance did not sufficiently deter violations or otherwise increase 
compliance. it relied upon enforcement data and historical information from osha, ins, 
state agencies, and other sources to target industries that:

  employed high concentrations of low-wage workers and substantial numbers of 

immigrant workers (legal and unauthorized) who were unlikely to complain about 
violations;

  were undergoing rapid growth or contraction in a changing, often global 

marketplace; and 

  included prominent corporations that could help to effect compliance throughout 

their supply chains. (us dol 2001, 6)

the  garment  manufacturing,  health  care,  and  agriculture  industries  met  these  criteria 
nationally, as did several locally targeted industry sectors (us dol 2001, 7, 8). during 
inspections, whd surveyed randomly selected establishments within targeted industries 
and  industry  sectors.  this  allowed  it  to  establish  baseline  information  on  patterns  of 
noncompliance. as part of a multi-faceted strategy, whd educated consumers, workers, 
and contractors; conducted investigations; imposed civil sanctions, including back wages, 
liquidated  damages,  and  the  return  of  gains  realized  from  the  sale  of  goods  produced 
in  violation  of  the  flsa;  referred  cases  for  criminal  prosecution;  entered  compliance 
agreements with multi-establishment and lead employers; established strike forces in select 
low-wage  industries;  and  intensively  monitored  targeted  employers  by  reviewing  their 
payroll records and time cards, interviewing employees, recommending corrective action, 

37

us labor standards enforcementand making unannounced visits (us dol 2001, 11-12).
subsequent surveys, typically two or three years later, measured changes in compliance 
levels. although premised on a long-term, unflagging commitment to changing behavior 
in select industries, whd measured its success over a relatively short period.  this may 
explain, in part, why compliance rates did not uniformly or steadily improve in the targeted 
industries and sectors during these years (us dol 2001, 36).  additionally, the studies may 
have failed to account for external factors, such as the penetration of imports or increased 
out-sourcing. whd attributed what it viewed as disappointing results in us garment 
centers to competition by offshore manufacturers, as well as to pricing and consolidation 
by apparel retailers (14).
during  this  era,  whd  developed  an  innovative  compliance  strategy  of  pressuring 
manufacturers and their suppliers by embargoing (preventing the delivery) of hot cargo 
goods produced in violation of the flsa (weil 2007, 140-142). under this initiative, whd 
required manufacturers to develop compliance programs with subcontractors, which led to 
decreases in wage-and-hour and other violations (uscir 1993a).  
an  analysis  of  data  collected  through  whd  surveys  of  the  southern  california  (1998 
and 2000) and new york (1999 and 2001) garment industries confirmed that intensive 
monitoring  increased  overall  compliance  with  minimum  wage  laws,  and  led  to  fewer 
violations  and  less  severe  violations  per  worker  (us  dol  2001,  13-15).  whd  also 
found that compliance was higher in firms that paid workers through their regular payroll 
systems than in those that did not; compliance was lower among new and small businesses; 
compliance improved when contractors could renegotiate prices with manufacturers when 
circumstances changed; and top-down investigations of retailers effectively engaged them 
in efforts to address problems of noncompliance in their supply chains (14-15).
whds work during this era confirmed the importance of:
 rigorously identifying problem industries and sectors;

 
  pursuing multi-pronged education and enforcement strategies (in partnership with 

others), with severe penalties for repeat or egregious offenders;

  assessing the effectiveness of strategies, and making adjustments in response;
  exerting pressure on manufacturers, retailers, multi-establishment businesses, and 

brand-name agencies in order to enlist them in monitoring their contractors; and

  adopting a sustained, multi-year approach to ensuring compliance in industries with a 

long history of labor violations.   

under  the  george  w.  bush  administration  (2001  to  2009),  whd  prioritized  outreach, 
educational activities, and compliance assistance, primarily to employer groups (lasowski 
2008). during this period, the number of establishments subject to whds jurisdiction 
grew  significantly  (weil  2007,  6;  bernhardt  and  mcgrath  2005).22 yet  its  investigative 

22  between 1975 and 2004, the number of workers within whds jurisdiction grew 55 percent, the number 
of business establishments covered by whd increased by 112 percent, and the number of whd investigators 
decreased by 14 percent.

38

journal on migration and human securitystaff fell from 945 to 731. staffing at us dols office of the solicitor also continued a 
long decline, from 786 employees in fy 1992 to 590 in fy 2009, as did the number of 
flsa  law  suits  filed  by  the  solicitors  office  (weil  2007,  90).23   the  gao  issued  two 
sharply critical reports on whds planning, prioritization, and investigative work during 
this period (lasowski 2008; kutz and meyer 2009).
in 2004, however, whd reported that it had improved compliance in the garment, long-
term  health  care  industry  and  agricultural  commodities  industries  (us  dol  2004,  80-
81). it attributed these results to  compliance assistance in the form of fact sheets and 
worker rights cards, in-person consultations with employers, and compliance agreements 
with nursing homes and farm bureaus. it also successfully monitored garment industry 
employers  through  unannounced  visits,  review  of  payroll  records  and  timecards,  and 
interviews with employees.  
under the obama administration, whd staffing has increased: us dol plans to increase 
the number of whd investigators to 1,132 by the end of fy 2014 (us dol 2013). in 
addition, whd has revisited several strategies from the clinton era.  in particular, it has 
sought to identify problem industries and practices through:

  current population survey data on industries that pay sub-minimum wages and 

require more than 40 hours of work per week (i.e. potential overtime pay violators); 

  federal and state complaint databases;
  whd-commissioned and academic studies on industries and business clusters 

thought to violate labor standards at high rates; 

  investigator reports; 
  partnerships with labor unions, consular offices, worker centers, and other entities 

with direct access to low-wage workers; and

  state datasets, commissioned reports and other non-traditional information sources.  

whd  has  also  prioritized  analysis  of  statistically  reliable  samples  of  firms  in  targeted 
industries to determine the extent and nature of their noncompliance with the law and to 
test if it has accurately identified problem industries, sectors, and firms.  
whd is attempting to create communities of compliance by targeting lead or dominant 
employers that can influence contractors, suppliers, and other entities within their ambit. it 
also plans to revitalize the clinton-era strategy of pressuring private corporations to create 
monitoring programs for their contractors and subcontractors (us dol 2011, 30-32). in the 
case of business clusters or independent firms, it seeks to target known violators in particular 
geographic areas and, thus, to dissuade similar firms (in their proximity) from violating the 
law through public education and media coverage before, during, and after enforcement 
actions. it uses the media to educate employers, workers, and community members about 
workplace  rights  and  the  consequences  of  violations.  it  also  plans  to  measure  baseline 
compliance in targeted industry sectors over multiple years and to monitor these sectors.    
23  between fy 1987 and fy 2007, the number of flsa law suits filed by the office of the solicitor fell 
from 705 to 151.

39

us labor standards enforcementwhd  has  also  prioritized  leveraging  enforcement  resources  through  partnerships  with 
state labor standards enforcement agencies.  to date, working relationships between states 
and whd have largely involved case referrals. however, improved data sharing, including 
possible aggregate analysis of federal and state data, may prove to be an effective form of 
collaboration, particularly on issues of common concern like employee misclassification.  
whd has historically reported on metrics like back wages collected, penalties assessed, 
resources expended, cases concluded, and other outputs (table 1) (lasowski 2008, 17-21).24  
it has not reported on the link between these metrics and its overarching goals of deterrence 
and compliance. nor does its case management database record the different contractual 
and employment relationships at targeted work sites, which would make it a more useful 
tool in effecting compliance and deterrence (weil 2007, 91). meeting these goals, however, 
will require more sophisticated research, enforcement strategies and metrics. 

recommendations for legal and administrative reform 
this  section  describes  the  characteristics  of  an  effective  labor  standards  enforcement 
system and recommends legal and administrative reforms. it argues that the united states 
needs to strengthen its federal labor laws, legalize a substantial share of its unauthorized 
population,  and  increase  federal  and  state  labor  standards  enforcement  resources.  an 
effective enforcement system would seek to deter violations and would continuously assess 
the deterrent effects of its strategies. whd and other regulators need to improve their ability 
to  identify  problem  industries,  sectors  and  firms;  to  map  their  structures,  relationships, 
and the distinct incentives of employers within them; and to evaluate the effectiveness of 
their programs.  robust partnerships, status-blind strategies, and an aggressive response to 
problem of employee misclassification will also be key to this response. 

strengthening labor standards, expanding resources and 
reforming us immigration law

federal labor laws set significant standards for minimum wage, overtime pay, child labor, 
safe and healthy workplaces, anti-discrimination, and freedom to organize and to bargain 
collectively. however, gaps in coverage undermine the underlying goals of these laws, 
particularly  in  industries,  sectors  and  firms  that  employ  substantial  numbers  of  low-
wage immigrants. in addition, labor standards enforcement agencies receive insufficient 
resources, given the scope of their responsibilities. 
by  way  of  comparison,  in  fy  2012,    the  two  u.s.  department  of  homeland  security 
(dhs)  immigration  enforcement  agencies,  customs  and  border  protection  (cbp)  and 
immigration  and  customs  enforcement  (ice),  received  16-times  more  funding  (a 
combined  $17.6  billion)  than whd,  osha  and  nlrb  (which  received  less  than  $1.1 
billion combined) (us dol 2012a; us dol 2012b; nlrb 2012; dhs 2012). in addition, 
the $17.6 billion figure, while covering some non-enforcement costs, likely understates 
immigration enforcement spending because it fails to include signature dhs enforcement 
programs that are not located within cbp or ice. it also does not count the substantial 

24  gao has criticized whd for failing to track certain performance metrics, including how often willful and 
repeat violations were found, and for frequently changing metrics.

us labor standards enforcementimmigration enforcement expenses borne by other federal agencies, by the federal court 
system,  or  by  states  and  localities.  immigration  enforcement  programs  can  impede  the 
exercise  and  protection  of  labor  rights.  to  cite  two  examples,  the  electronic  employer 
verification process has been found to drive low-wage immigrant laborers underground 
and effectively outside the reach of government regulators (lofstrom, bohn, and raphael 
2011,  25).  in  addition,  inter-operable  criminal  and  immigration  screening  systems  can 
result in the deportation of workers who are arrested based on false accusations (cho and 
smith 2013, 3; meissner, kerwin, chishti and bergeron 2013, 119-120). 
congress  should  comprehensively  review  federal,  state,  and  local  labor  and  workplace 
safety and health laws. among other reforms, it should: extend core labor protections to 
categories of employees who are now exempt or otherwise not substantially afforded these 
protections; strengthen penalties so they meaningfully deter violations; and provide for the 
tolling of statute of limitation periods upon the filing of complaints.  
as part of this review, congress should consider granting us dol authority to compel 
payment of back wages, liquidated damages, and civil monetary penalties. it should also 
pass legislation to make unauthorized workers eligible for payment of back wages under 
the nlra and to ensure that all remedies under the flsa, osha act, nlra and other 
workplace protection laws are available to all workers, regardless of their immigration status.
congress  should  also  pass  comprehensive  immigration  reform  legislation,  including  a 
legalization program for a substantial percentage of the us unauthorized population. legal 
status  would  make  low-wage  immigrant  workers  less  vulnerable  to  workplace  abuses 
and allow them to exercise their labor rights without fear of deportation.  immigration 
reform legislation should include substantial funding increases for federal and state labor 
standards  enforcement  agencies.  rigorous  labor  standards  enforcement  would  create  a 
strong disincentive to hiring unauthorized workers, diminish the competitive disadvantage 
faced by good-faith employers, and help to ensure that bad-faith employers do not exploit 
low-wage  immigrant  laborers  and  drive  down  wages  and  working  conditions  for  other 
workers. 

leveraging additional resources and pursuing high-impact
strategies

while labor standards enforcement resources should be increased, federal and state agencies 
will never be able to investigate, penalize, or monitor a significant share of the employers 
subject to their jurisdictions. thus, these agencies need to prioritize the use of their limited 
resources, leverage additional resources, and pursue cost-effective, high-impact strategies. 
their overall goal should be to maximize compliance with the law and deter violations. 
they should establish metrics that reflect these goals.   
voluntary  compliance  can  typically  be  achieved  by  educating  otherwise  law-abiding 
employers on the law and by applying graduated, proportional penalties for occasional 
violations. for employers that willfully, repeatedly, or severely violate the law, enforcement 
agencies should pursue significant civil monetary penalties, liquidated damages, injunctive 
relief, and criminal sanctions. they should also enlist lead or dominant corporations to 
pressure the employers within their spheres of influence to comply with the law. 

42

journal on migration and human securitywhd should leverage additional enforcement resources through expanded partnerships 
with  other  federal  agencies,  states,  and  localities;  consulates;  business  and  trade 
associations; labor unions and worker centers; faith-based groups and other stakeholders. 
such partnerships would improve whds ability to educate employers, employees, and 
the public on the law; reach vulnerable workers who are unlikely to register complaints; 
identify  problem  industries  and  employers;  chart  the  complex  relationships  in  fissured 
industries;  pursue  employers  who  violate  labor  and  related  laws;  train  employees  how  
to file complaints; test and evaluate enforcement strategies; and monitor compliance with 
the law.  
us dol already tracks and maps state labor laws. however, it should expand its collaboration 
with state enforcement agencies by creating an office of federal/state labor standards that 
would survey states annually on their enforcement resources, priorities, and activities as a 
means to share best practices and research, to inform federal and state planning processes, 
to promote partnerships, and to avoid enforcement redundancies. the goal of this office 
should be to establish a continuous learning and enforcement cycle that helps participating 
agencies to identify problem industries, understand business models and tactics designed to 
evade the law, coordinate education and enforcement strategies, evaluate the effectiveness 
strategies, and adjust their programs accordingly. state labor enforcement agencies should 
likewise develop more expansive partnerships with federal and state agencies, business 
associations, labor unions, worker centers, and faith-based groups.

identifying industries and firms that substantially violate 
labor standards

effective labor standards enforcement turns on the ability of federal and state regulators to 
identify industries and firms that substantially violate labor standards.  unauthorized and 
other low-wage immigrants have long worked at high rates in certain industries and firms 
that substantially violate these laws.
a  congressionally-mandated  study  in  1991  compared  firms  that  violated  employment 
verification requirements, with those that violated the flsas minimum wage, overtime, 
and child labor provisions (us dol 1991, 19-20). the study reviewed administrative data 
on  the  non-agricultural  investigations  opened  and  closed  by whd  between  october  1, 
1987 and january 31, 1990 (11, 21). roughly one-half of the investigated firms had been 
targeted under us dols special targeted enforcement program (step) (15, 21). firms 
selected for the step program were deemed to be more likely to employ unauthorized 
immigrants (15). the study further distinguished between firms in high- and low-alien 
industries: it defined high-alien industries as non-agricultural industries that routinely 
employ illegal aliens (26).
the study found that whd-investigated firms violated labor and immigration standards at 
high rates: 24.1 percent violated only the flsa, 18.5 percent violated only employment 
verification rules, and 42.7 percent violated both sets of standards (us dol 1991, 20-21). 
step-designated firms proved only marginally more likely to violate the flsa (69 percent 
compared to 64 percent) and slightly more likely to violate both immigration and labor laws 
(46 percent compared to 39 percent) (21). the study posited that these modest differences 
reflected a lack of hard evidence by whd in determining which firms merited the step

us labor standards enforcementdesignation  (us  dol  1991).  in  addition,  employers  in  the  five  high-alien  industries 
committed flsa violations (69 percent versus 66 percent) and minimum wage violations 
(16 percent versus 14 percent) at slightly higher rates, but they were marginally less likely 
to violate overtime pay requirements (23, 27). 
in 2008, the center for urban economic development, the national employment law 
project,  and  the  ucla  institute  for  research  on  labor  and  employment  surveyed 
4,387 persons working in low-wage industries in chicago, los angeles, and new york 
(bernhardt et al. 2009). respondents included workers who: (1) were at least 18 years 
old; (2) worked in front-line jobs (i.e. not management or professional workers); and 
(3) worked in industries for which the median wage for front-line workers was less than  
85 percent of the citys median wage (56). foreign-born persons represented 70 percent of 
the total respondents, and nearly 40 percent were thought to be unauthorized (14-15, 43-45, 
58, 62).  
the study started with a seed group of workers and used their social networks and the 
networks  of  successive  respondents  to  identify  survey  participants  (bernhardt  et  al. 
2009, 56-58). its authors attempted to reduce the bias inherent in snowball sampling 
by accounting for differences in social network size. the survey found widespread labor 
standards violations. based on hours worked and pay received the week prior to the survey, 
it appeared that more than one-fourth of all respondents had been paid sub-minimum wages 
and 76.3 percent who had earned overtime pay had not received it (20). violations occurred 
at higher rates for unauthorized than for authorized foreign-born workers, for foreign-born 
than for us-born workers, and for foreign-born women than for foreign-born men (42-44). 
the study underscored the limits of complaint-driven enforcement. twenty percent of the 
workers surveyed had experienced a serious workplace problem in the previous 12 months 
but did not complain due mostly to fear of losing their jobs (24). another 20 percent either 
registered a complaint or attempted to form a union. of the latter, 43 percent experienced 
retaliation in the form of diminished hours and pay, threatened deportation, termination, 
or increased work (25). the report recommended more proactive, investigation-driven 
enforcement in low-wage industries with systemic violations (52).
another study analyzed formal labor charges, petitions, complaints, and other proceedings 
brought against companies that the ins district office in new york raided for immigration 
violations over a 30-month period between 1997 and 1999 (wishnie 2004, 389-395). of 
the 184 entities raided, 102 had been subject to formal federal or state labor investigations 
or proceedings, including 18 before multiple labor enforcement agencies. 
immigration enforcement at work sites with a history of labor standards complaints and 
investigations can potentially chill the exercise of labor rights by unauthorized immigrants. 
bad-faith employers exploit unauthorized workers by threatening to have them arrested 
and deported for protesting or reporting violations, and by acting on these threats (cho and 
smith 2013; bernhardt, mcgrath, and defilippis 2007, 36; browne-dianis et al. 2006; us 
dol 2008a; smith and ruckelshaus 2007, 565-566; human rights watch 2000, 33-35; 
kwong 1997, 172-174; preston 2007; greenhouse 2000; taylor 1999).
more recent studies suggest that employers gain an advantage over their competitors by 
hiring workers whose lack of status limits their work options. the studies analyze data 

44

journal on migration and human securityfrom  georgias  employer  file  and  individual  wage  file  from  1990  to  2006  (brown, 
hotchkiss,  and  quispe-agnoli  2009,  5-6;  hotchkiss  and  quispe-agnoli  2008,  23-27, 
40, 43; hotchkiss and quispe-agnoli 2009). they conclude that georgia employers paid 
unauthorized workers less than authorized employees, unauthorized workers had fewer 
work options than authorized workers (as measured by worker separations due to reduced 
wages), and firms benefitted competitively (as measured by firm survival) by employing 
the unauthorized.
the gao or us dol should commission and regularly update a study that matches industries 
and industry subsets that violate employment verification laws with those that violate labor 
laws.  such a study could serve as a centerpiece of federal and state labor enforcement 
planning. in addition, whd should draw on an exhaustive range of information to identify 
industries that violate labor standards at high rates in order to determine the nature of the 
violations and to map the structure of industries and the incentives of different employers 
within them.  it should conduct probabilistic sampling to determine the nature, incidence, 
and geographic concentrations of violations. probabilistic sampling will also allow whd 
to explore anomalies in broader datasets, like firms with low self-reported accident rates in 
industries with high rates of injury and fatality.
reports,  studies,  and  database  mining  should  be  supplemented  by  investigations  that 
include interviews with affected workers in their primary languages and consultation with 
stakeholders that enjoy access to and the confidence of low-wage workers. whd should 
prioritize the cases of employers that have been assessed penalties for violations of the 
law but have failed to pay them. it should publicize its findings in order to increase public 
awareness, accountability and support for its work.

targeting labor standards violations against low-wage workers
in fissured industries

over the last four years, us dol has commissioned a series of studies that identify and 
map the structures of industries that violate labor standards at high rates (weil 2010, 132-
135).  much  of  this  work  has  been  summarized  in  a  may  2010  report  titled  improving 
workplace conditions through strategic enforcement: a report to the wage and hour 
division (weil 2010). the report argues that whd should target industry sectors with large 
concentrations of vulnerable workers in which employer behavior could be changed in a 
lasting and systematic manner (75-77).  it concentrates on fissured industries, which are 
characterized by the extensive use of subcontracting, franchising, third-party management, 
and self-employed contractors. in such industries, the dominant employer, the one that 
links multiple smaller employers, may be a buyer at the end of a large supply chain (like 
wal-mart), a national, brand-name organization (like mcdonalds), a central production 
coordinator (like the large national home builder corporations), or a purchaser of services 
from multiple entities (like building owners) (24-25).
the research concludes that low-wage workers in fissured industries, including immigrants, 
are particularly vulnerable to labor standards violations (weil 2010, 18-19). it argues for 
enforcement strategies that take into consideration the non-traditional structures and the 
often-competing incentives of the corporate actors in these industries. fast-food outlets, 
for example, are owned both by large brand-name organizations and by franchisees that 

45

us labor standards enforcementoperate through highly prescriptive agreements. analysis of us dol investigation data 
from 2001 to 2005 found that fast-food outlets owned by brand-name corporations were 
more likely than franchisee-owned outlets to comply with the law. the study attributed 
the difference to the diverse incentives of branded organizations and franchisees (44-48). 
brand-name organizations seek to preserve the value of their brands through compliance 
with the law, as well as to ensure a flow of revenue from their franchisees. by contrast, 
franchisees  are  driven  by  shorter-term  considerations  of  profit  (revenue  minus  costs), 
giving them a stronger incentive than branded corporations to keep costs low and to violate 
the  law  (58-71). the  research  suggests  a  greater  need  to  direct whd  investigations  at 
franchisee-owned outlets than at outlets owned by branded corporations.  
whd should extend hot goods penalties, including the seizure and embargo of goods, 
to fissured industries, certain lean retailers, and others that violate labor standards at 
high rates (just pay working group 2010, 12). it should also target problem industries and 
practices through task forces comprised of federal and state labor standards enforcement 
and related agencies. whd and state enforcement agencies should formally evaluate their 
programs at least annually, and they should make strategic adjustments on a regular basis.  

deterring violators by pressuring dominant or lead employers in
an industry or geographic area 

because whd will never be able to investigate more than a fraction of the employers 
subject to its jurisdiction, deterrence should be a primary goal of its enforcement system. 
yet  the  deterrent  effect  of  whd  enforcement  strategies  has  been  difficult  to  measure, 
in part because whd has not traditionally collected data on the workplaces that it has 
not  investigated.  however,  recent  us  dol-commissioned  research  has  attempted  to 
measure  deterrence  by  analyzing  the  impact  of  prior  investigations  on  the  behavior  of 
subsequently investigated fast-food outlets and hotels and motels. this research has found 
that investigations can have a significant deterrent effect, depending, inter alia, on their 
geographic location, the businesses investigated, and the type of investigation.  
analyzing us  dol  data  from  2001  to  2005,  the  research  examined the  incidence and 
severity of labor standards violations among fast-food outlets in areas (measured by five-
digit zip code) where there had been investigations of top 20 fast-food outlets within the 
previous year, compared to areas in which no investigation had taken place (weil 2010, 
50-57). the research found that labor standards compliance, as measured by the percent of 
subsequently investigated outlets with no violations, steadily improved based on the number 
of  past  investigations  in  the  area.  likewise,  total  back  wages  owed  (per  investigation) 
steadily diminished based on the frequency of past investigations (weil 2010).
the  study  concluded  that  prior  investigations  lowered  the  total  back  wages  owed  by 
subsequently investigated outlets, lowered the number of employees found in violation, and 
lowered the average back wages owed per worker.  these trends grew more pronounced 
in the case of prior whd-directed (as opposed to complaint-driven) investigations. the 
report attributed this difference, in part, to the increased publicity generated by directed 
investigations.  however,  the  deterrent  effect  largely  disappeared  when  the  previous 
investigation(s) occurred in a larger geographic area, measured by a three-digit (not five-
digit) zip code.  

46

journal on migration and human securitylike  the  fast  food  industry,  the  hotel  and  motel  industry  rely  heavily  on  franchising 
arrangements:  roughly  80  percent  of  hotel  properties  are  franchised  (weil  2010,  61). 
ownership  and  operating  structures  in  franchise  arrangements  vary  significantly.  both 
brand-name corporations and franchisees may own an individual hotel or motel. brand 
corporations,  independent  management  companies,  and  other  entities  can  manage 
properties. the top 50 management companies operate 10 percent of all branded hotels 
and, thus, have wide-ranging influence within this industry (66-67).
the researchers sought to determine whether branded hotels acted as market leaders in 
setting and influencing policies and practices in particular geographic areas.  as with the 
fast food industry, the hotel-motel study looked at properties that were located in areas 
(five-digit zip code) that had experienced investigations in the previous year and compared 
them with properties in areas in which no investigations had occurred in the prior year.  it 
found that prior investigations of top-five brand hotels significantly improved subsequent 
compliance (measured by total back wages per investigation) by branded hotels in the area. 
by contrast, the impact of prior investigations of any hotel/motel property, or even of a top 
25 or a top 50 brand property, was far more modest (weil 2010, 71-72). prior investigations 
of top-five branded hotels and of independent hotels also substantially improved compliance 
by independent hotels (73). based on these results, the report concluded that hotels/motels 
follow the leader (71).
this  research  underscores  the  importance  of  identifying  the  lead  or  dominant  entities 
in particular industries and industry sub-sets, and of learning which employers watch 
each other and how they do so, whether through trade journals, membership associations, 
publicity, or word-of-mouth. 
it also highlights the need to measure the deterrent effect of whd enforcement strategies 
and to adjust strategies accordingly. deterrent-relevant factors in the fast food and hotel/
motel industries include the location of enforcement activities, their frequency, the entities 
targeted  (brand-name,  independent,  or  other),  and  the  type  of  enforcement  (complaint-
driven or agency-directed).  
finally, labor standards monitoring should be incorporated into existing systems, standards, 
and  procedures  used  by  brand  organizations  to  promote  quality  and  performance  in 
particular industries (weil 2010, 87). franchise agreements set forth the responsibilities 
of  franchisees  in  painstaking  detail.    regulators  should  consider  requiring  targeted 
organizations (franchisors) to monitor their franchisees through these agreements.  

ensuring that immigration enforcement does not compromise
labor standards enforcement, and vice versa 

labor standards have long applied to workers irrespective of their immigration status, and 
investigators have been reluctant to assume immigration responsibilities that might impede 
their ability to gain the confidence of unauthorized workers (uscir 1993b, 173, 177). 
the distinct purposes of immigration and labor laws argue for vigilance in ensuring that 
enforcement of one set of laws does not undermine the goals or enforcement of the other.  for 
this reason, us dol and dhs/ins have long operated under formal working arrangements 
that recognize that their respective missions require distinct and coordinated enforcement 

47

us labor standards enforcementtactics. in late 1996, ten years following passage of the immigration reform and control 
act  of  1986  (irca),  ins  adopted  a  policy  on  immigration  enforcement  during  labor 
disputes, which it incorporated into its operating instructions (oi) and subsequently into 
its special agent field manual.25  the policy attempted to block employers from triggering 
immigration investigations that would interfere with the exercise of their employees labor 
rights, and it encouraged unauthorized workers to bring complaints related to labor law 
violations. 
the policy applied to complaints or tips on potentially unauthorized workers, but only in 
situations in which a labor dispute was in progress. if an immigration officer suspected there 
was a pending dispute, he or she was required to make a reasonable attempt to determine 
whether this was indeed the case. if so, the oi required that an ins supervisor review the 
case. however, immigration officials could still move ahead with an enforcement action. 
the oi did not detail the remedy for a violation of these procedures. in a 2003 deportation 
proceeding, an immigration judge ordered the suppression of evidence due to inss failure 
to abide by these procedures.26  
in 1998, ins and us dol entered a memorandum of understanding (mou) to coordinate 
their  work  and  to  enhance  enforcement  of  labor  standards  and  employer  verification 
laws (ins, doj, and dol 1998). the mou assumed that labor standards enforcement 
could deter illegal immigration by denying the competitive advantages gained through 
the employment of highly vulnerable and exploitable workers at sub-standard wages and 
working conditions (ins, doj, and dol 1998). it stipulated that neither agency would 
take action that compromised their respective missions of worker protection (us dol) and 
immigration enforcement (ins). it affirmed ins policy not to interfere in labor disputes. 
in addition, it precluded us dol from inspecting for employment verification violations 
in investigations prompted by complaints alleging labor standards violations but not in 
investigations initiated by the agency.27 
the mou also called for reasonable efforts to ensure that arrested unauthorized workers 
would  not  be  deprived  of  appropriate  compensation  for  the  work  performed,  thereby 
affording an economic benefit to the employer from employment of unauthorized workers. 
it  did  not  preclude  ins/dhs  immigration  enforcement  activities  during  and  following 
labor organizing activities, and these activities, in fact, continued (kerwin and mccabe 
2011, 38).
on  march  31,  2011,  ice  and  us  dol  entered  a  mou  that  superseded  the  earlier 
agreement, but affirmed its goals. the mou seeks to prevent conflicts between the dhs 
and us dol in their civil work-site enforcement activities, to advance their respective 
missions, and to insulate enforcement from inappropriate manipulation by other parties 
(dhs and dol 2011). under the mou, ice must assess whether tips and leads related 
to immigration violations involve work sites with pending labor disputes or are motivated 
by an improper desire to manipulate a pending labor dispute, retaliate against employees 
for exercising their labor rights, or otherwise frustrate the enforcement of labor laws. the

48

journal on migration and human securitymou is subject to the same criticism as its predecessor because it allows ice to engage in 
work-site enforcement during a labor dispute in a broad range of circumstances.28 in cases 
involving immigration enforcement during a labor dispute, ice must:

  notify us dol of its activities unless to do so would violate a federal law or 

compromise an ice investigation;  

  produce detainees for interviews with us dol if it does not interfere with or delay 

removal proceedings;

  consider us dol requests to provide temporary immigration status to unauthorized 

immigrants who are needed as witnesses in us dol investigations.   

the  agencies  also  agreed  to  exchange  information  on  abusive  employment  practices 
against workers regardless of status and on labor standards violations, human smuggling 
and trafficking, child exploitation, extortion and forced labor. the mou creates a joint 
committee on implementation and it requires dhs and us dol to notify and train their 
employees on its requirements. the mou stipulates that it does not create any right or 
benefit to outside parties. 
us dol and dhs have long recognized the need to coordinate their work so that the 
enforcement activities of one agency do not compromise the operations and goals of the 
other. the two agencies should regularly evaluate the effectiveness of their march 2011 
mou, should issue regulations that codify its main provision, and should make it a high 
priority to train and instruct their staffs on its requirements.29  
the agencies should also certify victims of severe labor violations for u non-immigrant 
visas and promote the use of u visas in these circumstances (smith and cho 2013). u 
visas can be granted to victims of crimes who cooperate in the investigation and prosecution 
of crimes. allowing such workers to pursue their claims will diminish threats of retaliation 
and deportation by bad-faith employers. finally, as one scholar has argued, dols role in 
reviewing planned dhs/ice enforcement actions should be strengthened and enhanced 
(lee 2011). in particular, dhs should rely far more heavily on dol to determine whether 
a labor dispute is in progress at a dhs-targeted worksite or if an employer is retaliating 
against  an  employees  attempt  to  exercise  his  or  her  labor  rights.  dhs/ice  will  often 
have no way of knowing if their activities might frustrate the enforcement of labor laws 
without stronger ex ante collaboration with dol. the alternative is dhs/ice complicity 
in labor standards violations, as has been amply documented in several cases (cho and 
smith 2013).

28  these include investigations related to national security, critical infrastructure, or federal crimes other 
than illegal employment, or when directed by the secretary of dhs or the secretary of labor or a designee. 
29  section 274a(b)(3) of irca required employers to retain employment verification records and make 
them available to the ins or dol. it contemplated a role for dol in checking whether employers had 
adequately screened employees to determine their legal eligibility to work.  congress may need to revisit this 
provision in order to ensure status-blind enforcement.

49

us labor standards enforcementstatus blind enforcement and challenges created by disparate
remedies for labor standards violations

the supreme courts decision in hoffman plastic compounds, inc. v. nlrb represents 
the most consequential blurring in recent years of the line between immigration and labor 
standards enforcement.30 in a five-to-four decision, the court held that unauthorized workers 
illegally fired for union organizing did not qualify for back pay.  in dissent, justice stephen 
breyer criticized the majority for allowing employers to conclude that they can violate the 
labor laws at least once with impunity and by providing an incentive to find and to hire 
illegal-alien employees.31  
while it is difficult to assess the extent to which the denial of back pay to unauthorized 
workers has stifled labor organizing or has led to increased labor violations, commentators 
have argued that the hoffman decision exemplifies how labor standards, if not extended 
to unauthorized workers, can undermine the purposes of both immigration and labor laws 
(developments 2005, 2171-2290, 2229). according to human rights watch:

[t]he  hoffman  decision    promotes  new  and  perverse  forms  of  discrimination.  it 
creates  an  incentive  for  employers  to  hire  undocumented  workers  because  of  their 
new vulnerability in union-organizing efforts, rather than hiring documented workers 
or  citizens  . the  resulting  discrimination  is  two-fold:  first,  discrimination  against 
documented workers and citizens who are not hired because of their status, followed 
by discrimination against undocumented workers who are hired because of their status. 
(human rights watch 2004, 119)

the  courts  reasoningthat  labor  protections  should  not  be  extended  to  workers  who 
cannot legally workhas subsequently been adopted by courts in sexual discrimination, 
nonpayment  of  overtime,  and  workers  compensation  cases  (moran  2007;  smith  and 
ruckelshaus 2007, 565-566). it has also been used to deny the recovery of future earnings 
to injured workers under state statutes and common law (developments 2005, 2229-2231). 
at  the  same  time,  one  scholar  has  described  a  pattern  of  regulatory  resistance  to 
hoffman in federal labor standards and civil rights agencies that has taken the form of 
minimizing hoffmans application, expanding remedies for workplace abuse, facilitating 
the participation of workers in labor standards enforcement actions, and strengthening their 
ability to collect the wages owed them (chen 2012). the equal employment opportunity 
commission (eeoc), for example, has affirmed its commitment to status-blind enforcement, 
vigorous application of the law, and protection of unauthorized workers (chen 2012). in 
addition, us dol continues to enforce the flsa and the migrant and seasonal protection 
act without regard to immigration status (us dol 2008b). it distinguishes hoffman on 
the ground that the nlra allows but does not require back pay and hoffman involved an 
employee who sought back pay not for time he had worked, but for time he would have 
worked had he not been illegally discharged. by contrast, the flsa and mspa require 
back pay for unreimbursed hours that employees actually work. in distinguishing hoffman 
in these ways, regulators seem to be affirming that discriminatory enforcement practices 
undermine the core goals of labor and workplace protection laws.

journal on migration and human securityprioritizing misclassification of employees as independent
contractors 

effective enforcement requires the identification of industries, industry sectors, and business 
clusters with high rates of labor standards violations. it also requires that regulators possess 
thorough and timely information on how employers attempt to evade the law and avoid 
legal liability. the misclassification of employees, particularly low-wage immigrants, has 
been an enduring problem. while not a violation of federal law, misclassification is often 
prompted by a desire to avoid payment of social security, medicare, workers compensation 
or unemployment insurance premiums. in addition, independent contractors do not receive 
flsa, osha, nlra and other statutory protections.
standards used to classify workers as employees vary by federal and state statute, but 
they generally turn on an assessment of whether the employer controls and directs the 
employees  work  or,  conversely,  whether  the  employee/contractor  exercises  autonomy 
in the performance of their work (planmatics 2000, 2, 14-22). under section 530 of the 
revenue act of 1978, a worker can be treated as a non-employee for the purposes of 
employment taxes if the employer files federal tax returns in a manner that does not treat 
the  worker  as  an  employee,  if  the  employer  treats  individuals  in  substantially  similar 
positions as non-employees, and if there is a reasonable basis for treating the worker as a 
non-employee.32
although  difficult  to  quantify,  misclassification  appears  to  be  widespread.    in  1984,  the 
internal revenue service (irs) estimated that 3.4 million persons were misclassified. irs 
plans to revisit this issue, reviewing the extent of misclassification as part of a broader study 
on employment tax compliance (gao 2009, 10-11). a study conducted for us dol in 1998 
and 1999 on the impact of misclassification on unemployment insurance programs found 
substantial misclassification in the construction, manufacturing, home healthcare, and retail 
industries (planmatics 2000, 91). it noted the pervasive misclassification and exploitation of 
low-wage immigrant workers who are unaware of american worker arrangements, ethics, 
rights and laws and who do not protest misclassification owing to fear of deportation, 
language barriers and ignorance of worker rights (planmatics 2000, 35-36).
state  labor  officials  have  similarly  reported  that  immigrants  are  less  likely  to  know 
their  rights  and  more  likely  to  be  misclassified  than  other  types  of  workers  (gao 
2009, 19). several studies and at least one government task force have found high rates 
of misclassification in the construction industry, which employs substantial numbers of 
authorized and unauthorized immigrants (gao 2009, 14; new york state department of 
labor and joint enforcement taskforce 2009, 3). the national employment law project 
identified  20  studies  on  the  incidence  and  costs  of  misclassification  in  particular  states 
(leberstein 2010). most of these studies rely on audits of unemployment insurance and 
workers compensation programs.
many  employers  misclassify  employees  as  independent  contractors  to  avoid  the 
requirements  of  federal  laws.    others  do  so  by  mistake.  congress,  the  us  department 
of  justice,  and  relevant  federal  and  state  agencies  should  attempt  to  harmonize  the 
standards and definitions governing employees and independent contractors.  whd, in

us labor standards enforcementcoordination with the us dol office of the solicitor, should bring legal actions to clarify 
the boundaries of the employer/employee relationship in major industries (weil 2010, 80). 
us dol, irs, and other federal agencies should coordinate a nationwide effort to educate 
workers, employers, and the general public on these standards. as us dol has proposed, 
congress should pass legislation to shift the burden of proof to employers, requiring them 
to demonstrate that their employees are correctly classified. as the gao recommended in 
2009 whd should increase its focus on misclassification during its investigations; whd 
and  osha  should  share  information  on  misclassification  cases;  us  dol  and  the  irs 
should establish an interagency, federal/state partnership to address misclassification; and 
us dol and irs should develop a standard document on misclassification that employers 
can provide to new workers (gao 2009, 41-42). whd should also continue to prioritize 
joint federal-state initiatives to combat misclassification.

conclusion
while far from perfect, us labor standards embody enduring national goals. they reflect 
a national consensus that all workers should be paid the agreed upon wages, none should 
be paid below a certain minimum level, and certain workers should be paid additional 
amounts for extra hours that they work. in addition, they provide that workers should be 
able to organize and bargain collectively for better pay and working conditions; should 
be able to work in safe and healthy conditions; and that children should not work, except 
in very limited circumstances. employers, in turn, should not be able to deny core labor 
protections  to  their  workers,  whatever  their  skills,  backgrounds,  or  immigration  status. 
strengthened and well-enforced standards would safeguard all workers, while ensuring 
that bad-faith employers do not benefit at the expense of their law-abiding competitors.
