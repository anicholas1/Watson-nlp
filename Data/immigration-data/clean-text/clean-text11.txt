executive summary
the  obama  administration  has  developed  two  broad  programs  to  defer 
immigration enforcement actions against undocumented persons living in 
the united states: (1) deferred action for parents of americans and lawful 
permanent  residents  (dapa);  and  (2)  deferred  action  for  childhood 
arrivals  (daca).  the  daca  program,  which  began  in  august  2012, 
was  expanded  on  november  20,  2014.  dapa  and  the  daca  expansion 
(hereinafter referred to as daca-plus) are currently under review by the 
us supreme court and subject to an active injunction.
this paper offers a statistical portrait of the intended direct beneficiaries 
of dapa, daca, and daca-plus. it finds that potential dapa, daca, 
and daca-plus recipients are deeply embedded in us society, with high 
employment rates, extensive us family ties, long tenure, and substantial 
rates of english-language proficiency. the paper also notes various groups 
that  would  benefit  indirectly  from  the  full  implementation  of  dapa 
and  daca  or,  conversely,  would  suffer  from  the  removal  of  potential 
beneficiaries of these programs. for example, all those who would rely on 
the retirement programs of the us government will benefit from the high 
employment rates and relative youth of the daca population, while many 
us citizens who rely on the income of a dapa-eligible parent would fall 
into poverty or extreme poverty should that parent be removed from the 
united states.  
this paper offers an analysis of potential dapa and daca beneficiaries.  
in  an  earlier  study,  the  authors  made  the  case  for  immigration  reform 
based on long-term trends related to the us undocumented population,

2015). by contrast, this paper details the degree to which these populations 
have become embedded in us society. it also compares persons eligible for 
the original daca program with those eligible for daca-plus. 
as stated, the great majority of potential dapa and daca recipients enjoy 
strong family ties, long tenure, and high employment rates in the united 
states. nearly one-half of the dapa population and far higher percentages 
of the two daca populations speak english well, very well, or exclusively. 
an unknown, albeit not insubstantial percentage of both the dapa- and 
daca-eligible may already qualify for an immigration benefit or relief that 
would put them on a path to permanent residency and us citizenship. these 
mostly low-wage populations have relatively high rates of poverty and low 
rates of health insurance. not surprisingly, the educational attainment, 
school enrollment rates, and english-language proficiency of the daca-
eligible substantially exceed those of the dapa-eligible. both populations 
enjoy high levels of computer and internet access. 
the  center  for  migration  studies  (cms)  derived  its  estimates  on  the 
dapa- and daca-eligible from statistics on the foreign-born population 
collected  in  the  us  census  bureaus  american  community  survey 
(acs), as described in warren (2016). it first derived detailed estimates 
for all undocumented residents, and then used the characteristics of this 
population (e.g., year of entry, age at entry, etc.) to tabulate the numbers 
of those who would be eligible for dapa and daca in 2014, which is the 
most recent year available. 

introduction
the us supreme court has granted certiorari in united states v. texas,2 a legal challenge 
by  26  states  to  the  obama  administrations  decision  to  extend  deferred  action  to  the 
undocumented parents of us citizens and lawful permanent residents (lprs) and to expand 
eligibility for the daca program.3 the dapa program would apply to undocumented 
persons who are the parents of a us citizen or lpr as of november 20, 2014; who have 
continuously resided in the united states since january 1, 2010; and who do not fall within 
a us department of homeland security (dhs) immigration enforcement priority group. 

2  united states v. texas, no. 15-40238, (5th cir. tex. nov. 9, 2015), cert. granted, (u.s. january 19, 2016) 
(no. 15-674). the court granted certiorari on whether: (1) states that provide subsidized services or benefits 
to non-citizens who are granted deferred action have standing under the us constitution, art. iii and a 
justiciable cause of action under the administrative procedure act (apa) to challenge the november 20, 
2014 executive action; (2) the executive action is arbitrary and capricious or not in accordance with the 
law; (3) the executive action required notice-and-comment under the apa; and (4) it violates the take care 
clause of the us constitution, art. ii, 3.

potential beneficiaries of executive action programsthe original daca program covers undocumented persons who: (1) arrived in the united 
states  prior  to  age  16;  (2)  are  at  least  15  years  old  at  the  time  of  applying;4  (3)  were 
under age 31 and lacked lawful status on june 15, 2012; (4) have continuously resided 
in the united states since june 15, 2007; (5) were present in the united states on june 
15, 2012 and when requesting daca benefits; (6) are enrolled in school, have graduated 
from  high  school,  or  obtained  a  general  education  development  (ged)  certificate,  or 
were honorably discharged from the us coast guard or armed forces; (7) have not been 
convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor, or three or more other misdemeanors; and 
(8) do not threaten national security or public safety.5 on november 20, 2014, the obama 
administration sought to expand eligibility for the daca program by adjusting the entry 
date (to january 1, 2010) and removing the upward age restriction.6
both the dapa and daca-plus programs would provide deferred action (essentially a 
reprieve from or deferral of removal) and employment authorization for a renewable three-
year period.7 dapa and daca-plus were preliminarily enjoined in federal district court, 
and  the  fifth  circuit  court  of appeals  upheld  the  preliminary  injunction. the  original 
(current) daca program has not been affected by the injunction.

findings

dapa-eligible persons

cmss 2014 estimates of potential dapa beneficiaries reveal a large population with robust 
and longstanding ties to the united states. cms estimates that 3,776,000 us residents are 
eligible  for  dapa,  representing  about  35  percent  of  the  us  undocumented  population 
(warren 2016). by definition, persons eligible for dapa enjoy strong family connections 
in the united states. eighty-nine percent are parents of us citizens, 7 percent have lpr 
children, and 4 percent have both us citizen and lpr children (figure 1). in 2013, 261,000 
adult us citizen children lived in households with their dapa-eligible parents, and others 
(not captured in this figure) did not live with their parents. twenty percent of the dapa-
eligible (age 15 or over) are married to a us citizen or legal non-citizen. 
because us citizens and lprs can petition for immigrant visas for their spouses and adult 
us citizens can petition for their parents, a percentage of dapa recipients would also be

among the 4.3 million persons whose visa petitions have been approved, but who languish 
in  (often  multi-year)  backlogs  (bergeron  2013).8  they  are  also  among  the  substantial 
proportion of us undocumented residents who may be eligible for a range of immigration 
benefits or relief that (unlike dapa) would give them permanent status (wong et al. 2014). 
an estimated 175,600 us residents are eligible for both dapa and daca; that is, they 
were both brought to the united states as children and have a us citizen or lpr child.

potential dapa beneficiaries enjoy long tenure in the united states, with 81 percent having 
lived in the country for 10 years or more and 27 percent for 20 years or more (figure 2). 
forty-nine percent arrived prior to 2000.

united states, rather than endure separation from their petitioning us citizen or lpr family member.

the  dapa-eligible  also  work  at  high  rates:  94  percent  of  those  in  the  labor  force  are 
employed (table 1 and figure 3). in addition, they can be expected to continue to work for 
many years, given that 77 percent are within the prime working ages of 21 to 44. ninety-
nine percent are between ages 21 and 64.

least a high school education. about 719,000 or 26 percent of potential dapa beneficiaries 
work  in  managerial,  professional,  precision  production,  craft,  and  repair  occupations.

the  average  personal  income  of  the  dapa-eligible  is  $23,500.  sixty-eight  percent  of 
dapa households are at or above the poverty line, compared to 85.2 percent of the us 
population  as  a  whole  (us  census  2015,  13).  only  37  percent  of  the  dapa-eligible 
have health insurance. while not the subject of this report, the loss of income of a dapa 

21

potential beneficiaries of executive action programsrecipient, whether due to his or her removal or some other cause, would plunge the vast 
majority of these low-income, mixed-status families into poverty or extreme poverty.9

daca-eligible persons 

the original daca (almost 1.26 million) and the daca-plus (259,000) programs cover 
an estimated 1,517,000 persons or roughly 14 percent of the us undocumented population. 
between  2012  and  2015,  us  citizenship  and  immigration  service  (uscis)  approved 
699,832 initial (as distinguished from renewal) daca applications.10 by contrast, the 
daca-plus program has not been implemented due to the court challenge. this paper 
analyzes the two populations separately, while recognizing that the relatively small size 
of the daca-plus population makes it difficult to compare or draw distinctions between 
the two groups. that said, potential daca-plus beneficiaries are, on average, older, have 
longer tenure in the united states, earn more, and are married at higher rates than the 
original daca-eligible. this is due to the elimination of an upward age restriction in the 
daca-plus program.  
given the dapa eligibility requirements and the relative youth of the daca-eligible, it 
is not surprising that the daca-eligible have far fewer us citizen and lpr children than 
the dapa-eligible. as stated, 175,600 daca-eligible are also dapa-eligible, meaning 
they both arrived as children and have a us citizen or lpr child. the daca-eligible are 
also married at far lower rates than the dapa-eligible. for original daca, 9 percent are 
married, including 4 percent to a us citizen or legal noncitizen, which would potentially 
qualify them for a family-based visa. of the daca-plus population, 22 percent are married, 
including 6 percent to a us citizen or a legal noncitizen. the marriage rates of the daca-
eligible will increase substantially in the upcoming years, as will other opportunities for 
them to secure permanent legal status.
like the dapa-eligible, most potential daca beneficiaries have lived in the united states 
for  long  periods.  eighty-five  percent  of  those  eligible  for  the  original  daca  program 
and 72 percent of those eligible for daca-plus have lived in the united states for more 
than 10 years. nineteen percent of the original daca population and 65 percent of the 
daca-plus population have been us residents for more than 20 years (figure 5). forty-
five percent of the original daca-eligible entered before 2000, compared to 72 percent of 
those eligible for daca-plus. 

9  several studies have detailed the negative developmental, emotional, and economic effects of the loss 
of a parent (through removal or otherwise) to his or her children and family (chaudry et al. 2010; dreby 
2015). other studies have described the economic and social benefits of legalization programs, including 
the original daca program.

eighty-nine  percent  of  the  original  daca-eligible  and  90  percent  of  the  daca-plus

percent of potential daca-plus beneficiaries work in managerial, professional, precision 
production, craft, and repair occupations. the youth and low unemployment rates of the 
two daca-eligible populations bode well for their participation in the aging us labor 
force for decades to come. such participation may prove crucial to the us governments 
efforts to meet its social security and senior medical-care obligations given that the number 
of us residents age 65 or older, driven by the baby boomer generation, is projected to 
double from 43.1 million to 83.7 million between 2012 and 2050 (ortman et al. 2014).

95 percent and 38 percent, respectively, for the daca-plus population (figure 6). these 
figures will increase due to the youth and substantial school enrollment rates of the two 
daca  populations,  particularly  the  original  daca  population:  46  percent  of  original

course, proficiency in more than one language can be a decided advantage in the globalized

overview of methodology

estimates for all undocumented residents

the estimation began with the reported characteristics of non-us citizens in the micro 
data of the acs in 2010. for the estimation procedure, the three relevant data items from 
the survey are country of birth, citizenship, and year of entry. noncitizens that entered 
the  united  states  before  1982  are  excluded  because  most  of  them  legalized  under  the 
immigration reform and control act of 1986 and nearly all of the remainder would have 
left the undocumented resident population over the following 30 years.12
 

12  undocumented residents can leave that population in four ways  they can adjust to legal status, be 
removed from the united states, leave the united states voluntarily, or die.

26

journal on migration and human securitythe methodology involved three major steps: (1) applying a series of edits, referred to here 
as logical edits,13 to identify and remove as many legal noncitizens as possible based 
on responses in the survey; (2) deriving separate population totals, for 145 countries or 
areas, for undocumented residents in 2010; and (3) using those population totals to make 
final selections of individual respondents in the acs to be classified as undocumented 
residents. the same procedures were followed for each of the 145 countries or areas, and 
the estimates were updated each year from 2010 to 2014. a more detailed description of the 
data sources and methods is available in warren (2016).
the final step in the methodology was to adjust the estimates for under-enumeration. the 
most recent entrants were assumed to have the highest undercount rates (about 12 percent), 
and  the  undercount  rate  declines  steadily  with  length  of  residence,  falling  to  2  percent 
for those who entered in 1982. the estimated undercount rate for the entire population is 
approximately 7.5 percent.

estimates for dapa and daca populations

after  deriving  detailed  estimates  for  the  entire  population,  computing  the  number  and 
characteristics  of  people  eligible  for  dapa  and  daca  was  straightforward,  although 
the  undocumented  population  characteristics  from  the  acs  do  not  exactly  match  the 
requirements for eligibility. the number eligible for dapa was estimated by tabulating the 
number of undocumented residents who were parents of a us citizen or a legal non-citizen 
in 2014 and had resided in the united states since january 2010.
estimates  for  the  original  daca  program  were  derived  by  tabulating  the  number  of 
undocumented persons who were under age 16 when they arrived; (2) were at least 15 
years old in 2014; (3) were under age 31 and lacked lawful status in 2012; (4) entered the 
united states before 2008; (5) were present in the united states in 2012, and; (6) were 
enrolled in school or had graduated from high school. the estimates for the daca-plus 
program were computed by adjusting the entry date (to january 1, 2010) and removing the 
upward age restriction.

conclusion 
in many respects, the dapa-eligible resemble typical first-generation immigrants. they 
are employed at very high rates (generally in lower-paying jobs), have lower than average 
levels of educational attainment and school enrollment, have integrated more slowly than 
the daca-eligible by standard indicia like english-language proficiency, and are strongly 
connected through marriage and their children to the united states.  
potential daca-plus beneficiaries have lived in the united states longer, earn more, and 
are married at higher rates than those eligible for the original daca program. however, 

13  the term logical edit refers to the process of determining probable legal status by examining survey 
data; respondents were assigned to the legal category if they worked in occupations that generally require 
legal status, were legal temporary migrants, were immediate relatives of us citizens, received public 
benefits, such as medicare and (in some cases) medicaid, were from countries where most arrivals would 
be refugees, or were age 60 or older at entry.

27

potential beneficiaries of executive action programsboth daca-eligible populations resemble the prototypical children of immigrants. high 
rates of the daca eligible work, attend school, speak english, and have strong family ties 
in the united states. these factors augur well for their future contributions to us society. 
both the dapa and daca populations also include substantial numbers of persons who 
may  otherwise  qualify  for  permanent  legal  status  and  us  citizenship.  the  paper  finds 
that the dapa- and daca-eligible are enmeshed and deeply embedded in us families, 
workplace, and society.
