executive summary
in  2013,  the  center  for  migration  studies  of  new york  (cms)  initiated  a  project 
to  bring  concentrated  academic  and  policy  attention  to  the  us  refugee  protection 
system,  broadly  understood  to  encompass  refugees,  asylum  seekers  and  refugee-
like populations in need of protection. the initiative gave rise to a series of papers 
published in 2014 and 2015, which cms  is releasing as a special collection in its 
journal on migration and human security on the 35th anniversary of the refugee act 
of 1980. this introductory essay situates the papers in the collection within a broader 
discussion of state compliance with international law, impediments to protection, us 
protection  programs,  vulnerable  populations,  and  due  process  concerns.  the  essay 
sets forth extensive policy recommendations to strengthen the system drawn from the 
papers, legislative proposals, and other sources.

introduction
the refugee act of 1980 represented a high water mark in us refugee law and policy, 
and in the united states history as a haven for the persecuted and dispossessed.1 the act 
sought to harmonize us law with the 1951 united nations (un) convention relating to 
the status of refugees and the 1967 protocol relating to the status of refugees.2 it sought 
to revise and regularize3 us refugee admission procedures, gave birth to the us refugee 
resettlement  program,  and  directed  that  a  procedure  be  established  for  noncitizens 
physically present in the united states or at a land border or port of entry, irrespective of 
such aliens status, to apply for asylum.4 
over  the  last  35  years,  the  united  states  has  resettled  nearly  three  million  refugees, 
provided political asylum to more than 400,000 persons, and extended different forms of 
temporary protection to hundreds of thousands of persons at any one time (dhs 2014b, 39-
43; ins 2002, 96; bergeron 2014, 26-28). over the same period, however, the united states 
created a massive immigration enforcement and homeland security infrastructure, which

populations. in 1980, the budget of the immigration and naturalization service (ins) was 
$349.1 million (roughly $1 billion in 2015 dollars) (doj 2002, 106). by 2014, funding 
for  customs  and  border  protection  (cbp)  and  immigration  and  customs  enforcement 
(ice) of the department of homeland security (dhs) equaled a combined $18 billion 
(dhs 2014a, 49-50, 64), a figure which does not include the cost of providing immigration 
benefits (as ins did) and which excludes the substantial immigration enforcement spending 
by other federal agencies. restrictive legislation, jurisprudence, and enforcement practices 
have also eroded us refugee protections. among other challenges:

	 us interdiction and interception policies, post-9/11 immigration-related security 
measures, and the expedited removal process have denied access to protection to 
massive numbers of refugees and others fleeing desperate situations, have returned 
many to perilous situations, and have delayed the protection of others; 

	 due process deficiencies, evidentiary barriers, and the widespread use of immigrant 
detention have prevented a substantial percentage of bona fide asylum seekers from 
pursuing and prevailing in their claims; and 

	 us temporary protection programs, particularly for desperate non-refugees seeking 

admission, have proven to be limited, inflexible, and inadequate. 

in 2013, the center for migration studies of new york (cms) initiated a project to bring 
concentrated academic and policy attention to the us refugee protection system, with the goal 
of strengthening and revitalizing this traditional pillar of us foreign policy, humanitarian 
programs, and the global refugee protection system. to that end, cms established and 
convened a working group consisting of experts from the academic, research, public policy, 
governmental, and nongovernmental communities. in june 2014, it hosted a symposium 
on the us refugee protection system. the event and working group meetings gave rise to 
a series of papers, published in the 2014 and 2015 volumes of the journal on migration 
and human security (jmhs), which cms is releasing as a special jmhs collection to 
commemorate the 35th anniversary of passage of the refugee act of 1980. 
this introductory essay is divided into four parts. section i provides an overview of the 
papers in the collection. section ii describes the challenge of state compliance with the 
refugee convention and protocol. it argues for a greater commitment to refugee protection 
based on state interest, human need, developments in international law, and promising new 
protection strategies. section iii describes: barriers to accessing protection in the united 
states; the continuum of us protection programs; the needs and treatment of the stateless, 
noncitizens in crisis situations, mexican asylum seekers, and migrant children from mexico 
and the central americas northern triangle states; and cross-cutting due process issues. 
this section also highlights policy recommendations drawn from the papers, legislative 
proposals,  scholarship,  and  human  rights  reporting.  section  iv  argues  that  the  success 
of us refugee protection policies depends on their incorporation within a broader set of 
diplomatic, economic development, rule of law, and human security commitments.

i. papers in the collection
mark r. von sternberg opens the collection with an analysis of the us refugee protection 

206

journal on migration and human securitysystem from the perspective of international law. in examining us migrant interdiction, 
repatriation, and pre-screening programs, von sternberg argues that the responsibility not 
to refoule is triggered whenever the nation exercises power, whether that be on the high 
sea or through some pre-screening device (von sternberg 2014, 354). moreover, non-
refoulement places on states the subsidiary obligation to determine if a noncitizen may be 
persecuted, tortured, or severely harmed if returned (ibid., 332), regardless of whether or 
not he or she requests asylum or another form of protection.5 von sternberg also examines 
and critiques the us asylum system and temporary protection programs.
anastasia  brown  and  todd  scribner  analyze  the  us  refugee  resettlement  program, 
explaining how a public-private partnership that assisted in the resettlement of hundreds of 
thousands of displaced persons following world war ii laid the groundwork for the refugee 
act of 1980 and the us refugee resettlement program. since 1980, the united states has 
resettled nearly three million refugees and the lives saved as a consequence demonstrate 
the  programs  success  (brown  and  scribner  2014,  102).  nevertheless,  federal  backing 
for resettlement has decreased over the years, placing participating states, localities, and 
nongovernmental organizations (ngos) under increasing strain and eroding public support 
for the program. the programs core integration strategyself-sufficiency through early 
employmentfails to meet the needs of growing numbers of refugees, and coordination 
and information sharing between federal, state, and ngo partner agencies has been far 
from optimal.
claire  bergeron  and  donald  kerwin  offer  complementary  papers  on  us  temporary 
protection  programs.  bergeron  assesses  the  temporary  protected  status  (tps)  program 
which,  notwithstanding  its  name,  has  been  used  to  provide  long-term  protection  to 
hundreds of thousands of noncitizens from nations that have suffered from armed conflict, 
natural disaster, and other extraordinary conditions. bergeron argues that extended tps 
designations run contrary to congressional intent, lock beneficiaries into a legal limbo, 
and impede their integration. 
kerwin examines us temporary protection programs more broadly, including humanitarian 
parole,  t  non-immigrant  visas  for  survivors  of  human  trafficking,  and  u  non-
immigrant visas for survivors of crime who assist law enforcement officials. he maintains 
that the most glaring deficiency in the us refugee protection system is its inability to admit 
sufficient numbers of imperiled non-refugees from abroad. kerwin finds that temporary 
protection programs can, at their best, provide haven to endangered persons while states 
and ngos work with affected populations to create durable solutions for beneficiaries. 
however, us temporary protection programs rest primarily on executive discretion, fail to 
cover numerous at-risk populations, and do not typically lead to permanent status or other 
durable solutions. 
maryellen fullerton examines the problem of statelessness, particularly in regard to claims 
to political asylum. she describes the causes of statelessness, offers a taxonomy of stateless 
populations,  and  finds  that  the  absence  of  state  protection  and  avenues  to  legal  status 

5   article 33 of the refugee convention prohibits contracting states from expelling or returning a refugee 
to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, 
nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion, with an exception for refugees 
who constitute a danger to security of the country or community.

the us refugee protection systemcondemns stateless persons to a precarious existence in host states and prevents them from 
securing legal residency elsewhere (fullerton 2014, 146-49). the paper reviews two us 
federal appeals court decisions, the seventh circuits 2010 decision in haile v. holder,6 
an asylum case involving a young man rendered stateless by the ethiopian governments 
denationalization  of  ethnic  eritreans,  and  the  sixth  circuits  2011  decision  in  stserba 
v. holder,7 an asylum claim by a woman who became stateless when the soviet union 
collapsed and one of its successor nations, estonia, enacted a citizenship law that included 
a language requirement. 
sanjula  weerasinghe  and  abbie  taylor,  with  sarah  drury,  pitchaya  indravudh,  aaron 
gregg, and john flanagan, examine noncitizens caught in situations of violence, armed 
conflict,  war,  natural  and  man-made  disaster,  technological  hazards,  and  other  crises. 
the authors find that in these circumstances noncitizens tend to fall through the cracks 
because of failure to understand and/or take account of the unique challenges they face, and 
because extant frameworks and mechanisms insufficiently articulate the responsibilities of 
different actors (weerasinghe et al. 2015, 30). the paper culls best practices regarding the 
treatment of noncitizens from five sets of crises in 2011 and 2012: the libyan uprising that 
led to muammar gaddafis overthrow; the tohoku earthquake, tsunami, and fukushima 
nuclear accident in japan; hurricane sandy in the northeastern united states; flooding in 
thailand; and the disastrous conflict in syria. 
j. anna cabot explores the anomaly of low us approval rates of mexican asylum claims, 
despite  an  epidemic  of  violence  in  mexico.  she  examines  obstacles  encountered  by 
mexican and other asylum seekers along the us-mexico border, including the requirement 
that claims be considered in adversarial removal proceedings, narrow legal standards, the 
excessive use of detention, evidentiary burdens, extra-legal actions by border officials, and 
immigration judges who often rely on their own incomplete or inaccurate knowledge 
about country conditions in mexico to deny claims (cabot 2014, 373). 
elizabeth  carlson  and anna  gallagher  review  the  situation  of  child  migrants  who  are 
fleeing  gang-based  violence  in  mexico,  honduras,  guatemala,  and  el  salvador.  they 
report that us deportation policies, central american government mano dura strategies, 
and  shifting  international  drug  trafficking  routes  have  helped  to  build  and  strengthen 
transnational  criminal  enterprises  (carlson  and  gallagher  2015,  132-33).  the  authors 
highlight the role of gang recruitment and violence in child migration, as well as aggressive 
law enforcement tactics that treat even children without gang affiliation as suspected gang 
members.  domestic  violence,  extreme  poverty,  and  single-parent  households  increase 
the vulnerability of children to gang predation. yet despite high levels of violencethe 
northern triangle states of central america, particularly refugee sending communities, 
have the worlds highest homicide rates outside war zones (ibid., 133-37) immigration 
judges have been reluctant to recognize asylum claims involving gang-related violence and 
persecution.

parents unauthorized entry, period of entry, and us immigration history. thus, the authors 
ultimately attribute the increase in child migration to us reliance on mexican and central 
american laborers. 
melanie  nezer  examines  recent  legislative  developments  regarding  the  us  refugee 
protection  system.  while  congress  has  not  passed  significant  legislation  related  to  the 
asylum process in more than a decade, it has considered two sweeping bills that would 
have substantially strengthened the us system. moreover, in a rare example of bi-partisan 
consensus, it passed legislation to increase admissions of iraqi and afghan refugees who 
assisted us troops, to facilitate refugee processing of religious minorities from iran and 
the former soviet union, and to provide the executive with greater authority to exempt 
select refugees, asylum seekers, and asylees from the broad terrorism-related grounds of 
inadmissibility (trig). the paper offers a valuable summary and side-by-side comparison 
of the refugee and asylum provisions in five bills introduced in the 113th congress (nezer 
2014, 141). 

ii.  the  international  refugee  protection  system  and  the 
challenge of commitment 
at this writing, 145 states have acceded to the 1951 refugee convention, 146 states to 
the 1967 refugee protocol, 157 states to the 1984 convention against torture (cat), 194 
states to the 1989 convention on the rights of the child, 86 states to the 1954 convention 
relating  to  the  status  of  stateless  persons,  and  63  states  to  the  1961  convention  on 
the  reduction  of  statelessness.9 the  responsibilities  set  forth  in  these  pillars  of  public 
international law, particularly the right to non-refoulement, should long since have been 
incorporated into state law and practice. yet compliance with the refugee convention and 
protocol has been begrudging, half-hearted, and tepid at best. 
twenty-five years ago, david martin argued that the relatively progressive character of 
international law was an accidental and ironic byproduct  of decades of governmental 
hypocrisy (1989, 552). [i]n one of historys more pleasing ironies, he wrote, human 
rights  pronouncements  and  soft  law  in  the  form  of  resolutions,  recommendations, 
declarations, conclusions, or accords proliferated between 1945 and the 1970s precisely 
because states had no intention of honoring them and did not expect them to have any real 
prospective impact (552-53). yet to the chagrin of state officials, non-binding language 
helped  to  legitimize  the  growing  role  of  the  un,  inter-governmental  organizations  and 
ngos in areas that had formerly been the exclusive province of states (558). human rights

the us refugee protection systemorganizations, in particular, assumed the role of magnifying this hortatory language in 
domestic political debates and pressuring states to give it effect (560). in response, states 
did not so much renounce their past pronouncements, as develop ingenious ways to evade 
their force (559). 
while states have created asylum regimes for noncitizens that they could not block from 
entering, they have resisted extending non-refoulement to persons who would be in mere 
danger in their countries of origin, refusing to open their borders  to so extensive a 
category of claimants (martin 1989, 567). fears of uncontrolled migration, social disorder, 
and open-ended commitments often underlie state resistance to refugee protection policies.10 
states have been especially wary of institutionalized schemes that would commit them to 
take a proportion of future flows of unknown frequency and magnitude (suhrke 1998, 
397).11 
in the early 1980s, western governments began to adopt policies and enforcement strategies 
to discourage asylum seeking and to contain asylum seekers in territories proximate to 
their home countries (helton 2000, 68). favored strategies have included:

interdiction and interception;

stringent visa requirements;

	
	 carrier sanctions;
	
	 designation of rights-free regions, non-territory and international zones;
	 denial of entry at borders;
	
	 detention;
	 accelerated consideration of asylum claims;
	 narrow interpretations of refugee and asylum standards; and 
	

safe third-country requirements;

failure  to  permit  appeals  of  rejected  claims  (helton  2000,  68;  hathaway  and 
gammeltoft-hansen 2014, 6-7). 

detention centers have become a centerpiece of this system. refugee destination states 
have  successfully  diffused  detention  practices  to  a  large  number  of  states  on  their 
peripheries, helping to establish an archipelago of emerging detention regimes that literally 
span the globe (flynn 2014, 190). 
the us response to large-scale refugee movements, whether of central american children 
or desperate haitian migrants, has become formulaic. the political branches of the us 
government brand the waves, flow, or surge a national crisis (rather than a human 
crisis), agree in principle on the need to address root causes, and resort to default strategies 
like  containment,  interception,  repatriation,  border  enforcement,  and  detention-to-deter. 
since  9/11,  these  tactics  have  increasingly  been  justified  on  national  security  grounds 
(ginsburg 2010; kerwin 2005a). states and supranational entities also characterize them as 

10   mcadam (2005) states that in europe, there is a deep-seated fear that whole populations will flee on 
the basis of generalized violations if subsidiary protection status does not require individual harm to be 
demonstrated.
11   suhrke (1998) posits that states would be more likely to agree to responsibility sharing if they could 
quantify their commitment and had some assurance that they could control events that produce refugees 
(402).

journal on migration and human securityanti-smuggling or anti-trafficking imperatives (hathaway and gammeltoft-hansen 2014, 
6-7; flynn 2014, 176-78). in addition, states regularly combine rationales by raising the 
specter that hardened terrorists will use smugglersand endure life-threatening journeys 
by  land  or  seato  facilitate  their  travel  (kanter  2015;  kerwin  2005a).  most  recently, 
mexican  and  central  american  interception,  border  enforcement,  and  anti-smuggling 
initiatives have been central to the us response to the increased migration of children and 
families from these nations to the united states (gao 2015, 9-12; white house 2014b). 
developed states resort to a variety of mechanisms to enlist and engag[e] the sovereignty 
of developing states in carrying out these strategies. these mechanisms include diplomacy, 
financial incentives, the provision of equipment, machinery, or training, deployment of 
their own officials, joint or shared enforcement, direct migration control, and the use of 
regional  entities  like  frontex  to  intercept  migrants  (hathaway  and  gammeltoft-hansen 
2014, 9-10). because this menu of responses has become so entrenched, some have predicted 
that state protection will continue to wither and desperate people will increasingly turn to 
alternative networks and processes for protection, rather than continuing to rely forlornly 
on states (van hear 2012, 10). 
in these circumstances, the question becomes how to strengthen the refugee protection 
system, given the lack of good faith compliance with its core principles. several factors 
argue for a stronger commitment to refugee protection. first, some commentators have 
argued for a robust commitment to protection based on developed states interest in:

	

the promotion of a stable and moral world, one in which peace and respect for 
human rights are pervasive and firmly rooted (helton 2002, 120);

	 engagement in a system that systematizes humanitarian benevolence (hathaway 

and gammeltoft-hansen 2014, 4); or 

	 avoidance of the threat to the global economy, security, and stability if developing 
stateswhich  host  86  percent  (10.1  million)  of  the  worlds  refugees  (unhcr 
2014a, 17)are provoked to abandon this regime by insufficient burden-sharing 
by developed states (hathaway and gammeltoft-hansen 2014, 4-5).12 

second, most states recognize a responsibility to safeguard the rights of their own citizens 
and, in limited circumstances, the citizens of other states. although not honored in the 
syrian  civil  war,  accompanying  regional  conflict,  or  elsewhere,  the  responsibility  to 
protect enunciated by the international commission on protection and state sovereignty 
represents an acknowledgment of the interdependence of states and that a states legitimacy 
turns,  in  part,  on  its  commitment  to  human  rights.13  by  this  understanding,  states  that 
mistreat or threaten their citizens defy their own purpose (shacknove 1985, 279). more 
broadly, states pervert the concept of sovereignty when they use it as a weapon to abet 
violations of the human rights (helton 2002, 133). if refugeehood can be conceived as a 

12   but see suhrke 1998. suhrke questions whether developing states would become less generous if 
developed states established more restrictive resettlement and asylum policies. suhrke posits that collective 
action might occur along restrictive lines, result in downward harmonization of standards and practices, 
and lead to a burden-shift to less developed states and further restrictions on refugees (403, 412-13).
13   see cohen 2014. governments bear primary responsibility for their displaced citizens. however, 
when they cannot or will not assume this responsibility, international humanitarian organizations can offer 
their assistance and states cannot arbitrarily reject this offer (13).

211

the us refugee protection systemform of unprotected statelessness (shacknove 1985, 283), then statesindividually and 
collectivelybear the responsibility to prevent and eliminate it. 
third, a commitment to refugee protection enhances state authority and influence and, for 
this reason, should be attractive to states.14 successful, signature responses to refugee crises 
following world war ii and the vietnam war (suhrke 1998, 404, 413) allowed states to 
achieve their goals and fulfill their core responsibilities, which they could not have done 
unilaterally. in addition, states have not been forced to ratify the refugee convention and 
protocol and no international or supranational body is vested with the power to enforce 
the right of non-refoulement; it is a matter of sovereign state control (bhabha 1998, 705). 
fourth,  new  strategic  approaches  to  protection  may  lead  to  better  outcomes  and,  thus, 
potentially to greater state support. in the past, refugee protection initiatives often failed 
due to a lack of consultation with, and participation by, the affected people and due to 
disparagement of local knowledge and culture on the part of policymakers and planners 
(oliver-smith  and  de  sherbinin  2014,  23).  by  contrast,  a  human  rights  approach  to 
protection respects the choices of refugees and displaced persons, not just because this is 
the right approach, rooted as it is in notions of dignity and human rights, but because it 
is the most effective and workable approach (helton 2002, 198). such an approach does 
not focus solely on the expected result, but also on the road that will lead to processes 
that will generate the result and recognizes the individual as a right bearer with justified 
claims against the state and the state as a duty bearer with the responsibility to promote, 
respect, protect and fulfill its human rights obligations (abramovich, ceriani cernadas, 
and morlachetti 2011, 10).15
fifth, there is an emerging consensus, strongly advanced in the un high level dialogue 
on international migration and development, that rights-respecting migration policies can 
benefit not just migrants, but sending and receiving states as well (un 2006,  66, 77). 
most recently, t. alexander aleinikoff proposed a paradigm slide from a humanitarian 
approach to protracted refugee situations, to one that builds on the self-reliance and agency 
of refugees, prioritizes the development of host communities, and would presumably be 
more acceptable to host states (aleinikoff 2015, 4, 8). the un high commissioner for 
refugees (unhcr) has also attempted to appeal to the interest of developed states in 
migration control in order to induce their support for refugee protection in developing states 
(betts 2009, 171). in particular, unhcr has used the prospect of development assistance 
to  influence  hosting  states  to  improve  and  expand  refugee  protection  and  integration 
initiatives (ibid.). 
in the final analysis, however, recognition of the vast humanitarian need, coupled with a 
core commitment to human dignity and solidarity, represents the best hope for expanded 

14   cf. bhabha 1998. by way of analogy, the phenomenon of globalization is often seen to have 
irrevocably weakened the nation-state. however, the opposite may be closer to the truth: the expansion 
of free market economies seems to have enhanced the role and influence of nation-states. in the european 
union, states have upheld veto power over legislation vital to member states, reserved for state control 
areas of state competence, and resisted policies that conflict with national goals (701). 
15   see also black and collyer 2014. because migrants are in the best position to decide whether or not 
to migrate, the policy goals should be to avoid situations in which people are unable to move when they 
want to, not to promote policy that encourages them to move when they may not want to, and up-to-date 
information allowing them to make an informed choice (55).

and red crescent societies (ifrc) estimated that more than 70 million people had been 
displaced by conflict, political upheaval, violence and disasters  climate change and 
development projects and other events beyond their control, with most in situations of 
protracted or permanent displacement (ifrc 2012, 9, 14-15).16 by the end of 2013, there 
were  51.2  million  persons  who  had  been  forcibly  displaced  by  persecution,  conflict, 
generalized violence, or human rights violations, including 16.7 million refugees, 33.3 
million internally displaced persons (the highest number ever recorded), 10 million stateless 
persons, and 1.2 million with pending asylum applications (unhcr 2014a, 5,23). 
asylum  applications  in  industrialized  nations  have  risen  substantially  in  recent  years. 
unhcr  estimates  that  new  applications  for  866,000  individuals  were  submitted  in  44 
industrialized nations in 2014, with increases from 369,300 to 714,300 between 2012 and 
2014 in european union (eu) member states and from 98,900 to 134,600 in the united 
states and canada (unhcr 2015, 8). for the second consecutive year, germany received 
the most new claims (from 41,330 in 2010 to 173,070 in 2014), followed by the united 
states (from 49,310 in 2010 to 121,160 in 2014).17 syrians represented the largest number 
of new applicants (149,641), followed by iraqis (68,719), afghanis (59,472), serbians and 
kosovars (55,668), eritreans (48,402), and pakistanis (26,332) (ibid., 23). behind these 
figures stand millions of individuals whose lives and well-being depend on generous and 
well-coordinated refugee protection policies. 

iii.  the  us  refugee  protection  system:  challenges  and 
recommendations for reform 
this section falls into four, overlapping parts. the first part examines barriers to access to 
protection in the united states. it covers migrant interdiction, security-related immigration 
measures, expedited removal, the us-canada safe third-country agreement, and immigrant 
detention.  the  second  analyzes  the  continuum  of  us  refugee  protection  programs, 
starting with refugee resettlement and ending with temporary protection programs. the 
third  explores  the  needs  and  treatment  of  the  stateless,  immigrants  in  crisis  situations, 
and migrant children from mexico and central america. the fourth covers due process 
issues,  including  legal  representation,  insufficient  immigration  court  resources,  and  the 
competency and professionalism of immigration judges and immigration officials. 
the proposed reforms set forth in this section draw heavily on nezers summary of relevant 
legislative developments in the 113th congress and from the sweeping refugee protection 
proposals  in  the  refugee  protection  act  of  2013  and  the  border  security,  economic 
opportunity, and immigration modernization act, the comprehensive reform bill which 
the senate passed in june 2013.18 

16   there were an estimated 232 million international migrants in 2013, with 136 million in developed 
regions and 96 million in developing regions (undp 2013). 
17   us affirmative asylum claims often include more than one person, but dhs reports on the number of 
claims, not individuals. thus, unhcr counts 1.393 individuals for each asylum claim submitted to dhs 
(unhcr 2015, 5).

the us refugee protection system1. barriers to access to protection

a. interdiction at sea

in its widely-criticized 1993 decision in sale v. haitian centers council,19 the us supreme 
court held that us policy of intercepting haitians in international waters and returning 
them to haiti without a protection interview did not offend the statutory withholding of 
removal standard or the refugee convention.20 the decisions real-world progeny has 
been characterized as the shout test.21 without being informed of their right to request 
protection, interdicted haitians must gain the attention of us officials on crowded ships 
and communicate that they are fearful of returning to haiti in order to be permitted to 
speak to a protection screening officer. the coast guard transfers haitians deemed to 
have  a  credible  fear  to  guantnamo  naval  base  for  an  interview  by  us  citizenship 
and  immigration  services  (uscis)  of  dhs.  uscis  can,  in  turn,  refer  refugees  to  the 
department of state (dos) for resettlement to a third country, although this seldom occurs 
(kerwin 2012, 22). the united states employs different processes for interdicted persons 
from different nations like cuba and china (flynn 2014, 179-180; kerwin 2012, 22). 

policy proposals

von sternberg contends that the sale decision created a legal black hole and violates 
the prohibition against refoulement. he maintains that sale should be repealed by statute 
(2014, 332-36), and that congress should clarify that jurisdiction exists whenever the 
nation exercises power in fact, whether that locus be on the high seas or through some pre-
screening device (ibid., 354). he also argues that sale should be revisited in light of the 
supreme courts 2008 decision in boumediene v. bush.22 in boumediene, the court held that 
the united states exercised plenary control, or practical sovereignty over guantnamo 
naval base in cuba and there was no jurisdictional bar to the federal courts consideration 
of a habeas petition filed by enemy combatants.
the refugee protection act of 2013 would have prohibited us officials from returning 
any alien interdicted or otherwise encountered in international waters or united states 
waters who expressed a fear of return to his or her country of departure, origin, or last 
habitual residence until the person had received a confidential interview by an asylum 
officer to determine if he or she had a well-founded fear of persecution on an enumerated 
ground or would have been subject to torture.23 a refugee who met this threshold test would 
have an opportunity to seek protection in a country in which he or she has family ties or 

19   509 us 155 (1993).
20   the unhcrs executive committee sharply disagreed with the sale decision, concluding that non-
refoulement did not imply any territorial restriction and that the international refugee regime would 
be rendered ineffective if states failed to adhere to this obligation. unhcr, executive committee,

resettlement, including the united states.24
us-supported interception, border enforcement, and detention programs in mexico and 
central america  have  not  been  as  well-documented  as  coast  guard  interdictions,  us 
airport  pre-screening  programs,  and  other  initiatives  designed  to  extend  us  borders 
outward  and  to  create  an  outer  ring  of  border  security.  nor  do  us  agencies  directly 
administer interception and detention programs in mexico and central america. however, 
the united states bears responsibility to ensure that intercepted migrants are screened for 
fear of persecution, torture and harm when it funds and otherwise exercises its power to 
prevent refugees and refugee-like populations from reaching its territory. 

b. security-related barriers to protection 

since  the  terrorist  attacks  of  september  11,  2001,  there  has  been  strong,  bipartisan 
consensus  on  the  need  to  safeguard  the  immigration  system.25 yet  immigration-related 
security measures have also prevented refugees and refugee-like persons from accessing 
protection. post-9/11 immigration-related security measures have included more in-person 
interviews  for  visa  applicants,  expanded  pre-travel  authorization  processes,  biometric 
screening, secure passports, and better information sharing between us law enforcement 
and intelligence agencies and with other nations (ginsburg 2010). 
the usa patriot act of 200126 and the real id act of 200527 significantly expanded 
the terrorism-related inadmissibility grounds (trig). under current law, a noncitizen is 
inadmissible if he or she committed an act that he or she knows, or reasonably should 
know, affords material support for the commission of a terrorist activity, to a person who 
has committed or plans to commit terrorist activity, or to a terrorist organization.28 the 
law broadly defines the terms material support, terrorist organization, and terrorist 
activity.29 
under  this  system,  pro-democracy  groups  and  groups  that  opposed  repressive  regimes 
have paradoxically been treated as undesignated tier iii terrorist organizations,30 and 
material support has included assistance provided under threat of death. as a result, the 

24   see also, acer and magner 2014. congress could also require the administration  to allow 
individuals interdicted in us or international waters potential access to us asylum procedures through the 
expedited removal process (474). 
25   the border security, economic opportunity, and immigration modernization act, s. 744, 113th cong. 
 3409 (2013) would have prohibited refugee admission until all security, law enforcement and other 
grounds of inadmissibility had been determined.

215

the us refugee protection systemtrig are far more expansive than the grounds for exclusion or the exceptions to the non-
refoulement obligation contemplated by the refugee convention (acer and magner 2014, 
454, 56), and have led to protracted delays and denials in tens of thousands of refugee and 
asylum cases (hrf 2009, 23-8; kerwin 2012, 15-6). 
in  february  2014,  dhs  issued  notice  that  it  would  exempt  from  the  material  support 
inadmissibility  grounds  certain  noncitizens  that  provided:  (1)  insignificant  material 
support;31 and (2) limited material support32 to tier iii organizations, members of such 
organizations, or individuals they knew or should have known had committed or planned 
to commit terrorist activity. on may 8, 2015, uscis issued policy memoranda to guide the 
exercise of the exemption authority set forth in these notices.33

policy proposals

congress and the administration should comprehensively review us immigration-related 
security measures in order to assess their effect on persons at risk of persecution, torture 
or other severe harm, and to develop policies and procedures to identify and protect such 
persons. 
the refugee protection act of 2013 would have defined terrorist activity and material 
support more narrowly than current law, and would have excluded activity committed 
under  duress  from  the  terrorism  definition.34 it  would  also  have  made  an  exception  for 
persons who could demonstrate that they did not know and should not reasonably have 
known  that  the  tier  iii  organization  to  which  they  belonged  was,  in  fact,  a  terrorist 
organization.35 the act would also have narrowed the definition of material support to 
support that is significant and of a kind directly relevant to terrorist activity.36 these 
reforms merit support.

 c. expedited removal

since passage of the illegal immigrant reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 
(iirira), asylum seekers stopped at or near the border without proper documents have 
been subject to a system of expedited removal and mandatory detention.37 the reach of the 
expedited removal system has been extended several times since its inception: the process 
now applies to those entering by sea and those arrested within 100 miles of us land and 
coastal borders. more than one million migrants have been removed through this process

between fy 2010 and fy 2012, the percentage of persons subject to expedited removal 
that expressed a fear of persecution and received a credible fear interview ranged from 
7 to 9 percent.38 this figure jumped to 15 percent in fy 2013. the increase in credible 
fear interviews and the release from detention of persons found to possess a credible fear 
have been criticized as a source of abuse of the us asylum system.39 in fact the expedited 
removal  process  is  replete  with  hurdles  and  difficult  for  asylum  seekers  to  negotiate 
(campos and friedland 2014, 4).
to be able to pursue a claim, an asylum seeker must first have the wherewithal, confidence, 
and knowledge to express a fear of persecution or to request asylum from an immigration 
officer.40 many asylum seekers cannot communicate their fear of persecution or need for 
asylum.  some  do  not  understand  this  requirement  or  speak  a  language  understood  by

the us refugee protection systemimmigration officials. others fear or distrust government officials. in addition, immigration 
officials often fail to inform persons facing expedited removal that us law protects certain 
persons at risk of persecution, torture or harm, and they fail to ask questions that would 
elicit their fears and concerns (pistone and hoeffner 2006, 176, 178-79). 
some immigration officials discourage asylum seekers from pursuing claims and encourage 
them to withdraw their applications for admission by threatening them with incarceration, 
unspecified  trouble  and  separation  from  their  families,  or  by  telling  them  that  the 
united states is full, or offering other fatuous rationales (cabot 2014, 366-67; uscirf 
2005b,  23-4).  even persons  who  express  a  fear  of  return are  denied admission at high 
rates (uscirf 2005b, 20-4). human rights watch reported that relatively low rates of 
honduran, guatemalan, el salvadoran, and mexican border crossers advanced to credible 
fear  interviews  in  fy  2011  and  2012  (hrw  2014,  21-3).41 yet  many  deported  central 
americans fear violence and specific threats which might have made them eligible for 
asylum in the united states (ibid., 15-19). 
an asylum seeker who surmounts these hurdles is entitled to an interview by a uscis 
asylum officer to determine if he or she has a credible fear of persecution.42 an asylum 
seeker can appeal a negative credible fear determination to an immigration judge within 
seven days.43 otherwise, he or she will be expeditiously removed. if deemed to have a 
credible fear, an asylum seeker can apply for asylum in immigration court. 
as discussed in section iii(1)(e) below, asylum seekers in expedited removal face mandatory 
detention until they establish a credible fear. dhss office of inspector general (oig) has 
recently reported that certain border patrol sectors also refer asylum seekers for criminal 
prosecution under operation streamline, prior to allowing them to access the credible fear 
and asylum adjudication processes.44 oig discovered this practice in two of four border 
patrol sectors that it examined in which this program operates. in these sectors, after asylum 
seekers are prosecuted and serve their sentences, they are again required to express a fear 
of persecution or to request asylum in order to receive a credible fear screening (dhs-oig 
2015, 16-17). in addition, border patrol officials incorrectly stated that immigration judges 
could vacate the criminal convictions of persons subsequently granted asylum (ibid., 17). 
the prosecution of asylum seekers violates article 31(1) of the refugee convention, which 
provides that contracting states shall not impose penalties, on account of their illegal entry 
or presence, on refugees who, coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom 
was threatened  enter or are present in their territory without authorization, provided 
they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their 
illegal entry or presence. criminal prosecution for illegal entry constitutes precisely such 
a penalty. this practice also undermines the right to seek asylum, makes it more difficult 
to sustain a claim, punishes asylum seekers for fleeing in the only way open to them in 

41   these rates may have increased in fy 2013 and fy 2014. in addition, the overall number of credible 
fear referrals rose dramatically from fy 2012 to fy 2013 (campos and friedland 2014, 1-2).

43   ina  235(b)(1)(b)(iii)(iii).

and migration corridors are referred for criminal prosecution  typically for illegal entry and illegal re-entry 
 prior to their removal.

the united states with a criminal record (kerwin 2005a, 756). 

policy proposals

to increase the fairness and efficiency of the asylum process and to reduce immigration 
court backlogs, both the refugee protection act of 2013 and the border security, economic 
opportunity,  and  immigration  modernization  act  would  have  given  uscis  asylum 
officers the option to grant asylum to persons they screen for credible fear or to refer such 
persons to immigration court for removal proceedings.45 the administrative conference of 
the united states recommended that asylum officers be further vested with the authority 
to grant parole to persons they believe to have a well-founded fear of persecution or fear 
of torture, and to recommend their release from detention (acus 2012, 15). parole allows 
noncitizens  to  enter  the  united  states  for  limited  periods  on  a  case-by-case  basis  for 
urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit, but does not lead to a permanent 
status.46 
in  response  to  the  practice  of  select  border  patrol  sectors  to  refer  asylum  seekers  for 
criminal prosecution prior to the credible fear interview, oig recommended that the chief 
of the border patrol develop guidance regarding persons who express a fear of persecution 
or return  at any time during their border patrol processing for streamline (ibid., 17). 
however, this decision should not lie with the border patrol. given that the border patrols 
practice in different sectors violates the refugee convention and eviscerates the asylum 
process, the dhs secretary and attorney general should issue a joint directive that clarifies 
that asylum seekers in expedited removal should in all cases be afforded a credible fear 
interview and, if successful, should have their asylum claims adjudicated. only if their 
claims are denied should they be referred, if at all, for criminal prosecution.

d. safe third-country agreement

in december 2002, the united states and canada entered a safe third-country agreement, 
which  requires  asylum  seekers  to  seek  protection  in  whichever  nation  they  reach  first, 
with exceptions for: (1) unaccompanied minors; (2) persons with family members in the 
receiving country who have been accepted as refugees, have a pending refugee claim, or 
have lawful status; and (3) persons who arrived with a validly issued visa or other valid 
admission document, or for whom no visa was required to enter.47 
at their worst, safe third-country agreements deny protection to refugees who are shuttled 
from one country to another without having their claims considered (von sternberg 2014, 
336-339). the us-canada agreement guarantees the consideration of an asylum claim, but

opportunity, and immigration modernization act, s. 744, 113th cong.  3404 (2013). see also, acer and 
magner 2014. acer and magner propose that all initial asylum claims, including those arising as a defense 
to removal, be adjudicated by the asylum corps (478).

219

the us refugee protection systemdenies an asylum seeker the ability to decide in which of the two states to exercise the right 
to seek protection. an asylum seeker may, for example, wish to pass through the united 
states  and  seek  asylum  in  canada,  given  its  more  generous  standards  related  to  gang-
related violence and gender-based claims, but they cannot do so. 

policy proposals

von sternberg proposes that the us-canada agreement be amended to permit onward 
travel and admission to the country of destination for those who have not filed asylum 
applications in the safe country of first presence, provided the jurisprudence of the country 
of destination provides a significantly more favorable framework or return would raise 
concerns over possible non-refoulement (von sternberg 2014, 355). however, because the 
agreement applies only to asylum seekers who present themselves at a port of entry, it also 
incentivizes illegal migration and smuggling and, thus, places asylum seekers in harms 
way (kerwin 2012, 27-8, von sternberg 2014, 338). in addition, it lacks any discernible 
security rationale (kerwin 2005a, 757). for all of these reasons, it should be repealed.

e. immigrant detention

the  detention  of  asylum  seekers  violates  international  law,  increases  the  difficulty  of 
securing legal representation, and causes many to abandon their claims (usccb-mrs 
and cms 2015, 171-74). detention also concentrates asylum seekers and their families 
in border communities, often away from family and support services (cabot 2014, 368). 
asylum seekers subject to expedited removal must be detained prior to a credible fear 
determination.48 while they can be released after establishing a credible fear, this often 
does not occur. in its most recent report on the detention of asylum seekers, ice reported 
that nearly one-half of the 29,035 asylum seekers who met the credible fear standard in fy 
2009 and fy 2010 remained in detention (dhs 2012, 4).
despite  an  immigration  court  docket  that  expedites  adjudication  of  detainee  removal 
proceedings, the removal adjudication process and, thus, the detention of persons seeking 
asylum and related forms of protection can be attenuated. persons who express a fear of 
violence to border officials, but who have received a removal order or previously been 
removed, must demonstrate a reasonable fear of persecution or torture in order to be 
referred to an immigration court for consideration of withholding of removal.49 absent 
exceptional circumstances, reasonable fear determinations must be conducted within 10 
days of referral to an asylum officer.50 however, they take substantially longer to schedule 
and additional time from the interview to service of the decision (cabot 2014, 368-69). 
thus, many persons in this situation spend prolonged periods in detention. 
although unhcr detention guidelines provide that detention should be a measure of last 
resort, with liberty being the default position (unhcr 2012, 14), the number of persons 
to pass through the us immigrant detention system each year has reached staggering levels

build massive new family detention centers along the us-mexico border (usccb-mrs 
and cms 2015, 164). yet the purpose of detentionto ensure court appearancescan be 
accomplished through far less costly and more humane supervised release programs (ibid., 
186-89).

policy proposals

the  refugee  protection  act  of  2013  would  have  reduced  the  detention  of  asylum 
seekers  through  a  secure  alternatives  program,  designed  to  prevent  flight  and  ensure 
court  appearances.51  the  border  security,  economic  opportunity,  and  immigration 
modernization act would likewise have created a secure alternatives program characterized 
by  appearance  assistance  services  and  community-based  supervision  programs.52 
these proposals deserve broad support. 
the department of justice (doj) and dhs should also, by regulation, establish custody 
hearings for arriving asylum seekers (acer and magner 2014, 471). in addition, dojs

the us refugee protection systemexecutive office for immigration review (eoir), which oversees the immigration court 
system, should expedite court hearings at the request of asylum seekers who wish to petition 
to bring at-risk family members to the united states (ibid., 482). 
the refugee act of 2013 provided that asylum seekers found to have a credible fear would 
be released within seven days, unless dhs could demonstrate that they posed a risk to the 
public or a flight risk.53 similarly, cabot proposes that release should be the norm for 
asylum seekers who have established a credible fear and that negative custody decisions in 
these circumstances should be subject to judicial review (cabot 2014, 368). 

2. us refugee protection programs

a. the refugee resettlement system

since passage of the refugee act of 1980, the united states has resettled nearly three 
million refugees, making this program one of the largest and most successful humanitarian 
endeavors in us history (brown and scribner 2014, 102). the united states resettles more 
refugees than all other developed nations combined. between 2009 and 2013, it accepted 
more than 70 percent of unhcr-submitted refugees for resettlement throughout the world 
(unhcr 2014c, 61). 
the us refugee definition tracks the convention definition.54 to qualify, a person must be 
outside his or her country of nationality or, if without a nationality, outside of the country of 
last habitual residence, and be unable or unwilling to return to and unable or unwilling 
to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country because of persecution or a 
well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in 
a particular social group, or political opinion.55 the law also provides for recognition of 
in-country refugees in certain circumstances.56 
the  resettlement  process  begins  each  year  when  the  president,  after  consulting  with 
congress, establishes an admissions ceiling and allocates resettlement numbers. between 
fy 2004 and fy 2015, admission ceilings have ranged from 70,000 to 80,000, with actual 
admissions  numbering  between  41,223  and  74,654  (bruno  2015,  3).57  refugees  must 
be  screened  and  admitted  on  an  individual  basis.  however,  congress  has  also  passed 
and  regularly  renewed  legislation,  called  the  lautenberg amendment,  which  creates  a 
presumption  of  refugee  status  for  religious  minorities  and  other  historically  persecuted 
groups from certain nations (nezer 2014, 128; kerwin 2014, 49).58

the detention of asylum seekers deemed to have a credible fear does not guard against spurious 
applications or further any other valid public interest (342). 
54   the international federation of the red cross reports that refugees represent less than one-fourth of the 
global population of persons displaced by violence, conflict, development projects, natural disasters, and 
technological hazards (ifrc 2012, 14-7).

the us refugee protection systemthe us refugee admissions program (usrap) depends on multiple institutional actors 
which  have  distinct  roles  and  priorities  (uscis  2013;  kerwin  2012,  6-8).  unhcr 
assesses  refugee  claims  and  refers  persons  for  resettlement.  the  population,  refugees 
and migration (prm) division of dos proposes admissions ceilings and priorities, and 
contracts  with  nongovernmental  resettlement  support  centers  to  screen  persons  for 
admission and prepare cases for review. uscis reviews refugee applications for eligibility 
and admissibility, interviews applicants, and coordinates background checks, which are 
conducted  by  dos,  the  federal  bureau  of  investigation,  and  the  central  intelligence 
agency.  cbp  agents  screen  refugees  for  admission  at  ports  of  entry. the  international 
organization for migration organizes refugee travel, which is funded through loans from 
prm.  the  us  department  of  health  and  human  services  (hhs)  office  of  refugee 
resettlement (orr) coordinates domestic resettlement services. 
prm  enters  cooperative  agreements  with  national  voluntary  agencies  (volags)  and 
provides reception and placement funding to cover housing, food, and other settlement 
costs during the refugees first 30 to 90 days in the nation (gao 2012, 7).59 orr provides 
refugee  cash  assistance  (rca),  refugee  medical  assistance  (rma),  and  social  service 
funding  through  state  refugee  coordinators  (ibid.,  8).  national  volags  have  extensive 
networks of community-based affiliates, which provide resettlement assistance to refugees 
and interface with state refugee coordinators and other stakeholders on placement plans.
not surprisingly for such a hydra-headed system, the resettlement process has long been 
burdened  by  poor  coordination  and  a  lack  of  inter-agency  information  sharing,  which 
negatively  affects  planning,  placement  decisions,  and  provision  of  support  services  to 
refugees with special needs and vulnerabilities (brown and scriber 2014, 114-15). often, 
for example, resettlement agencies do not learn about the mental health needs of refugees 
until they arrive (ibid., 114). information sharing has also been deficient regarding persons 
who have been abused by members of their own communities (ibid., 115). the refugee 
act of 1980 called for a presidentially appointed us coordinator for refugee affairs, with 
the  rank  of  ambassador  at  large,  to  develop  refugee  policy,  coordinate  admission  and 
resettlement  programs,  and  serve  as  a  liaison  to  foreign  governments,  us  government 
stakeholders, and participating ngos.60 however, this position was never created. 
in  addition,  some  of  the  participating  agencies  in  the  resettlement  process  have  goals 
which, in practice, can conflict. orr seeks to promote self-sufficiency and integration, 
for  example,  while  prm  seeks  to  resettle  the  most  vulnerable  refugees,  which  are  not 
necessarily  those  with  the  best  prospects  for  integration  (ibid.,  107).  furthermore,  the 
refugee resettlement programs almost singular emphasis on the goal of self-sufficiency 
through early employment can limit the ability of some refugees to adapt to their new 
communities, lead to their under-employment, and prevent them from securing the training, 
skills,  credentials,  and  services  that  might  improve  their  long-term  prospects  (gao 
2012, 29; brown and scribner 2014, 106). in recent years, refugee admissions have been 

provision has been repeatedly amended, typically to extend its expiration date and to modify the groups 
subject to its protection. 
59   in january 2010, prm doubled the reception and placement grant to $1,800 per refugee.

health,  and  mental  health  challenges  (gao  2012,  6).  refugees  with  special  needs  and 
vulnerabilities often find it particularly difficult to achieve self-sufficiency through early 
employment (brown and scribner, 107). 
the process of screening and resettling refugees can take two years or more (ibid., 115-16). 
although  necessary,  security  and  health  screening  can  substantially  delay  resettlement, 
particularly  because  the  timing  and  periods  of  validity  of  screenings  do  not  align  and 
by the time later checks are concluded, the first checks have [often] expired and must 
be redone (nezer 2014, 129). during this attenuated process, refugees and their family 
members must subsist in camps and urban settings, and are often at great risk. delays also 
diminish their life prospects. 
the federal government fails to share information with resettlement agencies in a timely 
manner on persons in the resettlement pipeline. as it stands, resettlement agencies must 
respond  to  a  request  for  proposals  by  the  end  of  june  each  year,  before  the  president 
consults  with  congress  on  admissions  or  sets  a  ceiling  on  admissions  and  allocations, 
leaving agencies without crucial information on refugees who may be resettled (brown 
and scribner 2014, 115-16). 
insufficient consultation by volags with state and local stakeholders on refugee placement 
decisions and community capacity has contributed to a political and public backlash against 
the program in some communities (gao 2012, 12-17). poor economic conditions have led 
some communities to request diminished numbers of refugees or even moratoriums on 
resettlement (ibid., 24). 
however, the main challenge and source of tension for non-federal stakeholders in usrap 
has  been  the  federal  governments  diminishing  financial  commitment  to  the  program 
(brown and scribner 2014, 110-12; us senate committee on foreign relations 2010). 
a survey of 59 resettlement cases in 2008 by lutheran immigration and refugee service 
(lirs) found that federal funding covered 39 percent of the cost of required services during 
the crucial first 90 days of resettlement (lirs 2009, 9). in addition, resettlement agencies 
must accommodate the variance and unpredictability of government funding and meet new 
requirements set forth in cooperative agreements, including those more fittingly performed 
by the federal government like convening quarterly meetings with states and localities on 
refugee placement and other issues (brown and scribner 2014, 111-12). 
states and localities have endured similar pressures. in 1980, the federal government fully 
reimbursed states for social assistance benefits provided to refugees during their first 36 
months in the country, and provided refugee cash assistance and refugee medical assistance 
over the same period. by 1991, the federal government had reduced the period of rca 
and rma benefits to eight months (nezer 2014, 138), based on concerns that the program 
appeared to be a form of welfare, rather than transitional assistance (brown and scribner 
2014, 108-9). by october 1990, the federal government stopped covering the state share 
(for refugees) of aid to families with dependent children, medicaid, and supplemental 
security income (ssi) (ibid., 109).
the orr funding formula to states is based on the number of arrivals within the previous 
36 months who live in the state at the beginning of the year. this formula short-changes 

225

the us refugee protection systemcommunities that are experiencing spikes in resettlement (ibid., 115). furthermore, federal 
funding does not necessarily follow refugees to their new communities (gao 2012, 21), 
which creates a burden on communities with large numbers of secondary refugee migrants. 
orr  has  traditionally  tracked  secondary  migration  of  refugees  through  state  reporting 
of refugee applications for services, a method that produces incomplete and inaccurate 
information (brown and scribner 2014, 113). 
protracted refugee situations, defined as situations in which refugees have been displaced 
for at least five years and have no immediate prospects for a durable solution, represent 
one of the greatest failures of the international refugee protection system (unhcr excom 
2009,  preamble).  an  estimated  two-thirds  of  the  worlds  refugees  meet  these  criteria 
(milner and loescher 2011), undermining the exercise of many of the rights set forth in the 
refugee convention.61 
persons who have languished for years in camps may no longer be able to sustain a refugee 
claim. in other cases, the us government may decide that members of groups of particular 
humanitarian  concern  or  otherwise  of  special  interest  should  be  admitted  as  refugees 
because of the history of discrimination and persecution against them.  
family reunification is a fundamental right and often an essential ingredient in refugee 
integration. yet the refugee resettlement system separates families and defines family more 
narrowly than many refugees do (nezer 2014, 127). among other impediments to family 
unity:

	 the children of a refugees spouse or the refugees grandchildren do not qualify 
for derivate status, preventing them from joining their parents and grandparents in 
the united states. 
if a refugee dies in the united states, his or her step-children and grandchildren 
may never be able to immigrate. 

	

	 a child in the care of a refugee who has been separated from his or her biological or 
adoptive parents, and does not otherwise qualify for admission, cannot be resettled 
with the refugee, even if it would be in his or her best interest. 

	 a refugee or asylee must petition for a qualifying family member to join him or her 

within two years of admission or the grant of asylum.
it  takes  several  months  (five  months  at  this  writing)  for  uscis  to  adjudicate 
applications for admission of family members who are seeking to join the refugee.

	

finally, refugees must petition to become lawful permanent residents (lprs) in the united 
states.  the  senate-passed  version  of  the  refugee act  of  1980  provided  that  refugees 
entering the united states under normal procedures would be admitted as lprs.62 however, 
the house-senate conferees replaced this provision with one permitting adjustment to lpr 
status after one-year. under current law, refugees whose admission has not been terminated, 
who have been physically present for at least one year, and who have not acquired lpr 
status, must at the end of such period apply for adjustment to lpr status.63 

61   these include the right to work and freedom of movement within the host state and travel outside it 
(refugee convention, articles 17, 26-28).

226

journal on migration and human securitypolicy proposals

to respond to the problem of poor coordination and insufficient information sharing among 
usraps constituent agencies, brown and scribner propose that:

	

the president appoint, after appropriate consultation with congress, a coordinator 
for refugee affairs; 

	 unhcrs  referral  for  resettlement  analysis  include  information  on  torture, 

sexual, and physical abuse; 

	 dos share arrival projections with orr in a more timely manner, and orr better 
align its funding mechanisms with the needs of communities that have to respond 
to influxes of new refugees; 

	 uscis share information with resettlement agencies far earlier in the process on 

persons who may be resettled in the upcoming year; and
the refugee program address obstacles to employment through better pre-arrival 
orientation programs (brown and scribner 2014, 107, 114-16).

	

to  address  the  need  for  better  consultation  with  state  and  local  stakeholders,  the  us 
government accountability office (gao) recommended that prm offer greater guidance 
on this priority to volags and state refugee coordinators, and that dos and hhs identify and 
disseminate promising practices for engaging local communities on refugee placement, 
local capacity, and other issues (gao 2012, 38). 
to  address  concerns  related  refugee  integration,  the  refugee  protection  act  of  2013 
provided that the comptroller general should undertake a study on the effectiveness of the 
resettlement program, how orr defines self-sufficiency, its success in assisting refugees 
to become self-sufficient, an analysis of unmet program needs, the funding levels necessary 
to meet unmet needs, and recommended statutory changes.64 the studys findings would 
presumably  lead  to  a  broader  conceptual  and  strategic  approach  to  the  integration  and 
well-being of refugees or, at least, towards persons with special needs, vulnerabilities, and 
challenges. similarly, gao recommended that hhs review orrs performance measures, 
with the goal of affording service providers greater flexibility and incentives to focus on 
longer term goals, including integration, independence from any government services, and 
career advancement (ibid., 39).
to address the need for better data on secondary refugee migration, brown and scribner 
propose that orr and resettlement agencies explore the feasibility of tracking secondary 
migration through the repayment of refugee travel loans to resettlement agencies (brown 
and scribner 2014, 113), which could ultimately lead to a more equitable distribution of 
resettlement  resources. to  address  funding  deficiencies  created  by  spikes  in  settlement 
(gao 2012, 15), orr should fund states to assist refugees based on past and projected 
numbers of refugees, rather than based solely on past admission levels. in addition, gao 
recommended that an emergency fund be created to identify and assist communities with 
large numbers of secondary refugee migrants (ibid., 29).
to  provide  the  authority  and  flexibility  to  admit  members  of  priority  groups  who  do 
not  consistently  meet  the  refugee  standard,  the  refugee  protection act  of  2013  would

227

the us refugee protection systemhave given the president authority, after appropriate consultation, to designate groups for 
admission whose resettlement is justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the 
national interest.65 these groups must have shared common characteristics that identify 
them as targets of persecution or other serious harm or have shared a common need for 
resettlement due to a specific vulnerability.66 the border security, economic opportunity, 
and immigration modernization act included a parallel provision.67
to  strengthen  families,  promote  family  unification,  and  increase  the  efficiency  of  the 
resettlement process, the refugee protection act of 2013 would have:

	

	

treated  the  children  of  a  refugees  or  asylees  spouse  or  child  as  derivative 
beneficiaries;68

	 allowed a child who has been separated from his or her parents and is living under 
the  care  of  a  refugee  to  be  resettled  with  the  refugee  if  it  is  in  his  or  her  best 
interests; and
required dhs to adjudicate refugee and asylee family reunification applications 
for spouses and minor children abroad within 90 days.69 

to  facilitate  integration  and  promote  efficiency,  the  refugee  protection  act  of  2013 
would  have  allowed  refugees  to  file  for  adjustment  to  lpr  status  three  months  before 
becoming eligible to adjust.70 it would also have extended ssi eligibility to refugees and 
trafficking victims from seven to 10 years.71 the border security, economic opportunity, 
and immigration modernization act would have waived the english language and civics 
requirement to naturalize for certain elderly and disabled refugees.72 

b. in-country refugee processing

in-country  refugee  processing  presents  conceptual  and  practical  difficulties  because, 
by definition, refugees fear persecution in their countries of nationality or last habitual 
residence. in addition, past us in-country refugee processing programs have not included 
sufficient  safeguards  for  applicants  (frelick  2003).  in-country  processing  can  also  be 
used to dissuade refugees from fleeing their home communities and to supplant refugee 
screening in third countries.
at the same time, the flight of migrant children from central america, the murder of untold 
numbers of migrants in transit in mexico, and the continued high incidence of us-mexico

journal on migration and human securityborder  crossing  deaths  have  highlighted  the  potential  risks  of  international  migration.73 
they have also illustrated that for some refugees, in-country processing is a safer and better 
option than irregular migration. 
in  december  2014,  the  obama  administration  announced  the  launch  of  a  modest  in-
country  refugee/parole  screening  program  for  certain  el  salvadoran,  guatemalan,  and 
honduran children. the program permits lawfully present us residents to apply to bring 
their children to the united states as refugees and it allows children found ineligible for 
refugee admission but at risk of harm to be considered for parole on a case-by-case basis 
(dos 2014). 
likewise,  the  presidential  determination  on  refugee  admissions  for  2015  provided  that 
honduran, guatemalan, and el salvadoran nationals, among others, may, if otherwise 
qualified, be considered refugees for the purpose of admission to the united states within 
their countries of nationality or habitual residence (white house 2014a). 

recommendation

in-country  refugee  processing  should  be  carried  out  with  strict  safeguards  designed  to 
protect confidentiality and as a complement to a robust and well-resourced system of third-
country refugee screening and processing. in addition, these programs should be regularly 
monitored and evaluated to ensure that they meet these conditions. the use of parole to 
admit non-refugees who are at risk of substantial harm should be expanded.

c. political asylum and related forms of protection 

the  united  states  uses  the  nomenclature  of  asylum  to  describe  the  assessment  and 
adjudication of refugee claims within its borders. uscis asylum officers consider claims 
presented  affirmatively;  that  is,  by  persons  who  are  not  in  removal  proceedings.  if 
denied by an asylum officer, affirmative applicants who lack legal status can seek asylum 
defensively in removal proceedings. since 1980, the united states has granted asylum to 
more than 400,000 persons (see table 1).
to secure asylum, applicants must satisfy the refugee definition and meet other criteria.74 
withholding of removal, a related form of protection, can be awarded to persons whose 
life or freedom would be threatened due to their race, religion, nationality, membership 
in a particular social group, or political opinion.75 withholding can also be granted if it 

73   see also humble 2014. intensive border security alone argues for a greater commitment to a 
functioning and effective method for migrants to apply for refugee status prior to reaching their desired 
destination country (57). 
74  ina 101(a)(42). asylum seekers cannot have persecuted others, been convicted of a particularly

removal.76 a person found eligible for protection based on the likelihood of torture who is 
nonetheless denied withholding, can be granted deferral of removal.77 
in  fy  2014,  immigration  judges  received  41,920  asylum  cases,  completing  36,614  of 
them, counting withdrawn and abandoned claims (eoir 2015, j2). of cases decided on 
the merits, immigration judges granted asylum in 8,775 cases and denied asylum in 9,222 
cases (eoir 2015, k1). uscis does not consistently report on affirmative asylum filings 
and its annual statistical report is published later than eoir statistical reports. in fy 2013, 
the most recent year reported on by uscis, the asylum corps granted asylum in 15,266 
affirmative cases (martin and yankay 2014, 6). 
in  fy  2014,  the  grant  rate  by  immigration  judges  of  asylum  cases  first  considered 
affirmatively (by asylum officers) was 75 percent and of purely defensive claims was 28 
percent (eoir 2015, k3). in fy 2014, immigration courts approved 1,463 withholding of 
removal claims or 12 percent of the cases in which withholding was sought, not counting 
cases in which both asylum and withholding were granted (ibid., k5). immigration courts 
granted  asylum,  withholding,  or  both  in  56  percent  of  the  cases  in  which  these  claims 
were made (ibid., k6). they also entertained 26,394 claims under the convention against 
torture, granting withholding in 415 cases and deferral from removal in 121 cases (ibid., 
m1).78
between 2010 and 2014, only germany exceeded the united states in new asylum seekers 
(434,300 claims compared to 403,300), among 44 industrialized nations (unhcr 2015, 
13). however, the united states ranks substantially lower in asylum seekers per 100,000 
inhabitants (at 1.3), falling below sweden (24.4 per 100,000), malta (17.5), luxembourg 
(12.6), switzerland and montenegro (12.3 each), and germany (5.3) (ibid.). 
the us asylum system has long been diminished by procedural bars to asylum, due process 
deficiencies, and the liberal use of detention. since passage of iirira, asylum seekers 
have been required to file their claims within one year of entry, with narrow exceptions 
based on extraordinary circumstances that account for a late-filed claim and changed 
circumstances that materially affect asylum eligibility.79 according to one study, more 
than 30 percent of the affirmative asylum cases filed between april, 16, 1998 and june 8, 
2009 failed to meet the one-year deadline (schrag et al. 2010, 688).80 this figure does not 
include the (unknown) number of asylum seekers who have been discouraged from filing 
after they missed the deadline. 
eoir  does  not  report  on  claims  barred  due  to  the  one-year  deadline  (ibid.,  768-69). 
however, a report by the us government accountability office (gao) concluded that 
meeting the filing requirement increased the likelihood of prevailing in an asylum claim in

77   8 cfr  208.17 (a) and (b).
78   the low number of reported approvals of convention against torture (cat) withholding and deferral 
of removal claims may be due to the facts that: (1) immigration judges that grant political asylum do 
not decide upon parallel cat claims in many cases; and (2) eoir does not report on cat grants of 
withholding or deferral of removal in cases in which asylum has also been granted.

the us refugee protection systemimmigration court by 40 percent in cases first considered affirmatively by uscis and 30 
percent in defensive claims (gao 2008, 30). another study found that 19 percent of 3,472 
asylum cases appealed to the board of immigration appeals (bia) between 2005 and 2008 
failed to meet the filing deadline (nijc, hrf and cir 2010, 6-7). long delays in non-
detained court cases can push asylum seekers beyond the one-year filing deadline through 
no fault of their own (cabot 2014, 371). 
the one-year filing deadline has not improved the governments ability to detect and prevent 
fraudulent claims (acer and magner 2013, 449). nor has it led to fewer meretricious claims. 
as proof, applicants who fail to meet the filing deadline but qualify for an exception have 
prevailed in their claims at roughly the same rate of those who meet the deadline (schrag 
et al. 2010, 745-46). the deadline has, however, barred consideration of an extraordinarily 
high percentage of asylum claims and has diverted scarce asylum officer and immigrant 
judge resources from consideration of the merits of claims (acer and magner 2014, 449- 
50). 
the refugee convention and protocol require that refugees be afforded the most favourable 
treatment accorded to nationals of a foreign country in the same circumstances, as regards 
the right to engage in wage earning employment to work.81 employment is also key to the 
exercise of other guaranteed rights. yet us asylum seekers must wait 150 days after they 
have submitted an asylum application to apply for employment authorization, and uscis 
has an additional 30 days to grant or deny the employment application.82 in addition, accrual 
of time toward the 150-day period can be stopped for any delay requested or caused by 
the applicant,83 and these delays occur in the vast majority of cases (hrw and csj 2013, 
18). as an example of the potential impact of these measures, non-detained asylum seekers 
must wait up to four years for their initial master calendar hearing in immigration court in 
el paso, at which point they can request asylum, and begin the long count-down toward 
employment authorization (cabot 2014, 373). 
us  asylum  applicants  must  establish  that  race,  religion,  nationality,  social  group 
membership, or political opinion was and will be at least one central reason for their 
persecution.84 in addition, immigration judges may require them to secure corroborating 
evidence of otherwise credible testimony, unless they do not have and cannot reasonably 
obtain it.85 because persecutors often hide their activities, it can be difficult for asylum 
seekers to establish the persecutors motive, to collect corroborating evidence (particularly 
for those who fled hurriedly), or to demonstrate past persecution.
under its 1985 decision in matter of acosta, the bia defined a social group as one whose 
members share a common, immutable characteristic that they either cannot change, or 
should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or 
consciences.86 in 2008, the bia narrowed this definition to require the social visibility 
of persecuted groups.87 the seventh circuit court of appeals criticized this standard on

journal on migration and human securitythe grounds that members of persecuted groups often do no look different from others and 
take pains to avoid being socially visible.88 cabot recounts an asylum claim, for example, 
of an informant to the us drug enforcement administration, whose claim was rejected 
because informants (for understandable reasons) hide their identities and are not socially 
visible (cabot 2014, 370). asylum seekers with gender-based claims would also struggle 
to meet the social visibility requirement (acer and magner 2014, 458). 
in 2004, the bia replaced social visibility with the term social distinction, in order 
to clarify that visibility or distinction did not require that a social group be literally 
or physically seen by the society at large, but must instead be perceived to be a discrete 
group.89 the social visibility and social distinction requirements have been adopted 
by several circuit courts of appeal, with the exception of the third and seventh circuits. 
as it stands, applicants for asylum or withholding of removal on account of membership 
in a social group must demonstrate that the group is composed of members who share a 
common immutable characteristic, which is defined with particularity, and socially 
distinct within the society in question.90 
finally,  asylum  claims  can  be  impeached  by  trial  counsel  and  denied  on  credibility 
grounds  by  immigration  judges  due  to  discrepancies  between  the  applicants  earlier 
statements  to  immigration  officials  and  their  court  testimony  (uscirf  2005b,  67-70). 
these discrepancies may be caused by the confusion, caution, or fear of asylum seekers, 
or they may result from poor training, insufficient interpretation, or the time pressure on 
immigration  officials. a  comprehensive  study  of  the  expedited  removal  process  by  the 
us commission on international religious freedom found that immigration officials in 
secondary inspection often:

failed to inform applicants regarding the possibility of protection;
failed to elicit information about possible asylum claims;
failed to refer applicants who expressed fear to credible fear interviews;

	
	
	
	 allowed applicants to sign their sworn statement without reviewing it;
	
	

included in the applicants statement assertions which they never made; and 
failed to include in completed forms  important information communicated by 
the applicant. (pistone and hoeffner 2006, 175-76). 

policy proposals

the one-year filing deadline has barred a high volume of meritorious claims, has created 
extraordinary  inefficiencies,  and  has  not  diminished  fraudulent  or  meretricious  claims. 
for these reasons, the refugee protection act of 2013 and the border security, economic 
opportunity,  and  immigration  modernization act  would  have  eliminated  the  one-year 
deadline and allowed asylum seekers whose claims had been barred by the filing deadline 
but who had been granted withholding of removal to move to re-open their cases over a 
two-year period.91

security,  economic  opportunity,  and  immigration  modernization  act  would  have 
provided employment authorization to asylum seekers 180 days after they filed an asylum 
application, irrespective of delays in the adjudication process caused by the asylum seeker.92 
similarly, the administrative conference of the united states recommended that asylum 
and withholding of removal applicants should presumptively qualify for employment 
authorization 150 days after filing an asylum application (acus 2012, 13). while these 
reforms would have reduced delays in securing authorization to work in most cases, they 
would not have allowed asylum seekers to sustain themselves and their families in the six 
months after they applied for asylum. thus, von sternberg proposes that uscis should 
provide employment authorization upon the filing of a non-frivolous asylum application 
(von sternberg 2014, 355). 
the refugee protection act of 2013 would have addressed the difficulties in establishing 
persecutors  motives  by  requiring  asylum  seekers  to  demonstrate  that  race,  religion, 
nationality, membership in a social group, or political opinion is a factor in the applicants 
persecution  or  fear  of  persecution.93  it  would  have  addressed  problems  related  to 
corroboration of testimony by allowing the applicant to meet his or her burden of proof 
through [d]irect or circumstantial evidence, including evidence that the state is unable to 
protect the applicant or that the state legal or social norms tolerate such persecution against 
persons like the applicant.94 
the refugee protection act of 2013 would also have eliminated the social visibility or 
distinction  requirement  by  codifying  the  acosta  standard,  and  defining  social  group 
to include any group whose members share a characteristic that is either immutable or 
fundamental to identity, conscience, or the exercise of the persons human rights such that 
the person should not be required to change it.95 
finally,  to  create  a  more  accurate  and  complete  record  in  asylum  cases  and  to  avoid 
unfounded, negative credibility determinations, cabot proposes that interpreter services be 
provided for initial interviews of asylum seekers and verbatim transcripts of interviews be 
provided to immigration judges (cabot 2014, 365-66). similarly, the secondary inspection 
interviews of persons in expedited removal should be videotaped (pistone and hoeffner 
2006, 203).

since the establishment of the tps program by the immigration act of 1990.96 however,

journal on migration and human securityand, given the narrow eligibility criteria for refugee admissions and asylum, are essential 
to a seamless and comprehensive system of protection. 
dhs can provide tps to groups from states that are experiencing armed conflict, natural 
disaster, and other extraordinary conditions which make it unsafe to return.97 tps affords 
legal status and work authorization for six to 18 months, with the possibility of extensions 
if the conditions leading to the group designation persist.98 extensions have been granted 
liberally since the programs inception, even in cases in which the conditions giving rise to 
the designation no longer obtain. recent statistics indicate that more than 340,000 persons 
hold tps status (bergeron 2014, s107). von sternberg asserts that tps approaches the 
ideal of protection based on humanitarian need set forth in the un guidelines on internal 
displacement (von sternberg 2014, 352).99 however, tps does not:

	 allow individuals to assert claims to protection unless they belong to a designated 

group; 
lead to lpr status for individual beneficiaries;100 

	
	 constitute  an  admission  or  parole,  according  to  doj,  which  would  allow 
beneficiaries to adjust to lpr status, although the sixth circuit court of appeals 
has rejected the dojs interpretation of the law (bergeron 2014, s113); 
treat recipients like refugees or asylees for the purposes of public benefit eligibility; 
	
	 apply to persons from designated states who enter the united states following the 
designated cut-off date, even family members of beneficiaries or those who have 
fled desperate situations; or 

	 allow beneficiaries to petition for the admission of close family members.

by way of comparison, the eu sought to harmonize the laws of member states and set 
forth minimum standards related to refugee protection in its 2004 qualification directive, 
which  was  recast  in  2011.101 in  doing  so,  it  created  a  category  of  persons  eligible  for 
subsidiary protection, defined as non-refugee third-country nationals or stateless persons 
who if returned to their countries of origin or of former habitual residence (for stateless 
persons), would face a real risk of suffering serious harm.102 the directive limits serious

punishment; or a serious and individual threat to a civilians life or person by reason of 
indiscriminate violence in situations of international or internal armed conflict.103 member 
states must issue residence permits to subsidiary protection beneficiaries and their family 
members for at least one year and renewals for two years absent compelling reasons of 
national security or public order.104 
beyond tps, the executive branch (dhs) can also exercise its discretion not to remove 
persons who would face violence, persecution, or extreme privation if returned to their home 
countries. the exercise of discretion has been formalized through programs like deferred 
enforced departure (ded) and deferred action (da) which immunize certain noncitizens 
from removal for temporary periods and provide them with employment authorization and 
other benefits. 
while dhs enjoys some discretion in how it provides temporary protection to persons in 
the united states, parole is the only available vehicle to admit non-refugees in substantial 
need of protection. prior to the refugee act of 1980, the united states used parole to admit 
large numbers  of de facto  refugees and persons  fleeing refugee-like situations  (kerwin 
2014, 51-2). the refugee act limited the use of parole to the admission of individuals and 
established a presumption against granting parole to refugees.105 at present, humanitarian 
parole is used sparingly and rarely as a protection vehicle (ibid., 52-3). nor do the relevant 
regulations single out refugees or persons in refugee-like situations for consideration for 
parole.106

policy proposals

bergeron presents several possible administrative and legislative fixes that would further 
the goal of providing tps for temporary periods to members of groups that do not meet 
the refugee definition, while also ensuring that long-term residents can integrate into the 
united states. she concludes that the best way to reconcile these twin goals would be to 
allow persons who have held tps status for more than 10 years to adjust to lpr status, 
while pursuing the repatriation of shorter-term tps beneficiaries whose status has ended. to 
provide permanent status to long-term beneficiaries of us temporary protection programs 
(including tps), congress could also pass legislation to: 

	 advance the inas registry date to january 1, 1999, which would allow temporary 
protection recipients and others who arrived prior to this date to apply for lpr 
status;107

	 establish a legalization program that would credit years in receipt of temporary 

103   eu 2011, article 15. 
104   eu 2011, article 24(2). 
105   as the united states debates the use of executive action to immunize unauthorized immigrants from 
possible removal, it is instructive to remember that concerns over the attorney generals admission of 
refugee-like groups through his parole authority contributed to passage of the refugee act of 1980.

journal on migration and human securityprotection toward the time required to earn legalization; and 

	 allow such persons to apply affirmatively for cancellation of removal (which 

affords lpr status) after 10 years (kerwin 2014, 65-6).

to lay the foundation for the voluntary return of short-term tps beneficiaries, the united 
states should prioritize the reconstruction, economic development, and establishment of 
the rule of law in tps-designated states (ibid., 63-4). 
dhs should also create a more inclusive tps determination process by hosting quarterly 
public  hearings  on  conditions  in  tps-designated  nations  and  in  nations  that  might  be 
eligible for a designation (ibid., 66). in addition, it should re-designate more states for 
tps, rather than simply extending tps for already designated groups. the former option 
would have the effect of extending tps to persons from re-designated states who have fled 
dangerous conditions and entered the united states between the initial designation and re-
designation periods (ibid., 66-7).
kerwin contends that the limited ability of the united states to admit non-refugees from 
abroad who are in desperate need of protection represents the most glaring deficiency in 
the us refugee protection system (kerwin 2014, 62-3). he proposes that congress create 
a non-immigrant protection visa for noncitizens that are at substantial risk of persecution, 
danger  or  harm  in  their  home  or  host  nations.  in  addition,  he  argues  that  dhs  should 
expand its use of parole in such cases (ibid.). 
because the number of approved u non-immigrant visas has exceeded the 10,000 cap for 
several consecutive years, the border security, economic opportunity, and immigration 
modernization act  would  have  increased  the  annual  limit  of  u  visas  to  18,000  and 
required  dhs  to  grant  employment  authorization  to  u  and  t  (trafficking)  non-
immigrant visa applicants on the date of the applications approval or, if earlier, 180 days 
after submission.108 

3. vulnerable populations

a. the stateless

the refugee convention was created in response to the plight of displaced and stateless 
persons  following world war  ii. yet  the  us  refugee  protection systemthough  firmly 
rooted in the refugee convention and protocol through the refugee act of 1980does not 
provide a discrete path to legal status for stateless persons. 
persons become stateless in three primary ways. first, they lose and then fail to obtain 
citizenship in cases of state succession (unhcr 2012, 13). second, they belong to groups 
targeted by discriminatory laws and policies like those, for example, that prevent mothers 
from passing on citizenship to their children, selectively deny birthright citizenship, or 
refuse to issue documents that would allow members of disfavored groups to establish 
citizenship (ibid., 14). third, they fall through the gaps in legal systems, including gaps

the us refugee protection systemcreated by incompatibilities between the laws of states recognizing citizenship primarily 
through blood relationship (jus sanguinis) and those recognizing citizenship through birth 
in the country (jus soli) (ibid.).109 
fullerton decries the lack of good estimates of the us stateless population and of reliable 
information  on  the  countries  from  which  they  came,  the  circumstances  through  which 
they became stateless, or any protection alternatives which they may be able to pursue 
(fullerton 2014, 161). she characterizes statelessness as an example of a protection and an 
information gap. despite the absence of legislation and the paucity of jurisprudence related 
to  the  stateless,  she  finds  that  persons  who  become  stateless  through  denationalization 
decrees  fit  more  easily  into  the  us  refugee  paradigm  and  may  be  presumed  to  have 
experienced past persecution. persons who become stateless due to the dissolution of states 
and discriminatory legislation in successor states may warrant a rebuttable presumption 
on the need for protection (ibid., 160). 
stateless  persons  come  to  the  attention  of  us  immigration  authorities,  if  at  all,  in  two 
primary ways. several hundred stateless persons each year make asylum claims. others 
do  not  seek  asylum,  but  cannot  be  removed  because  no  nation  will  recognize  them  or 
accept  their  return  (unhcr  2012,  22-3).  by  statute,  dhs  must  remove  noncitizens 
within 90 days following receipt of a removal order, but shall not release those who 
are inadmissible or deportable on criminal or national security grounds.110 in 2001, the 
us supreme court interpreted this provision to prevent indefinite detention, holding that 
six months after a removal order becomes final, the burden shifts to the government to 
show there is a significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.111 
as a result, dhs must release most persons who have been ordered removed and whom 
it cannot repatriate, including the stateless. in the case of both refugee and non-refugee 
stateless persons, however, us law offers no discrete path to legal status.

policy proposals

fullerton proposes that the federal government convene a task force to report on the size 
and composition of the us stateless population and the need for legislative, regulatory, and 
policy guidance concerning statelessness claims (fullerton 2014, 160). 
the refugee protection act of 2013 would have allowed the dhs secretary, in consultation 
with the secretary of state, to designate specific groups as stateless and to provide conditional 
lawful status to de jure stateless persons who are otherwise inadmissible or deportable, 
albeit not those inadmissible on criminal or security grounds.112 after five years, persons in 
conditional lawful status would have been permitted to apply for lpr status. the border 
security, economic opportunity, and immigration modernization act would have allowed 
stateless persons to adjust to lpr status one year after securing conditional lawful status.113 

109   the fourteenth amendment of the us constitution guarantees birthright citizenship, ensuring that 
statelessness cannot be inherited (unhcr 2012, 17). however, congress has regularly considered 
symbolic bills that would seek to deny birthright citizenship to the children of unauthorized persons.

journal on migration and human securityb. crisis migrants

the plight of noncitizens in crisis situations has received substantial attention in recent 
years through the un high level dialogue on international migration and development 
and the state-led migrants in countries in crisis (micic) initiative.114 weerasinghe et al. 
analyze the response to noncitizens in five crises in 2011 and 2012,115 identifying several 
problems with government responses toward noncitizens in these situations, including:

	 communication of information on the crisis in modes and languages that do not 

reach noncitizens; 
laws  and  policies  that  impede  access  to  relief  and  development  services  and 
otherwise do not account for the needs of noncitizens; 

	 difficulties in accessing relief services given the location of noncitizens, lack of 

	

	

	

translation services, and onerous documentation requirements; 
lack of consideration of noncitizens in disaster management laws, planning, and 
response; 
rogue authorities, militias, criminal enterprises, and other private actors that seek 
to exploit noncitizens; 

	 border restrictions that prevent noncitizens from migrating to safety; 
	
	

scapegoating and targeting of noncitizens for violence, arrest, and detention; and
the inability, negligence, or refusal of countries of origin to protect their citizens 
abroad by neglecting to issue them travel documents or provide them with access 
to embassy personnel (weerasinghe et al. 2015, 30-1, 41). 

the paper also provides a taxonomy of particularly vulnerable groups in crisis situations, 
including  persons  without  status,  domestic  workers,  refugees,  asylum  seekers,  stateless 
persons, and detainees. hundreds of thousands of palestinian refugees, for example, have 
been displaced in syria, and trapped in conflict zones, most unable to flee to neighboring 
countries. jordan has denied entry to palestinians who possess only syrian travel documents 
since early 2013 (weerasinghe et al. 2015, 40). 

policy proposals

weerasinghe et al. also offer recommendations to countries of origin and destination which 
respond to the problems that their paper identifies. in particular, they propose that states:

suspend immigration enforcement in the aftermath of a crisis;

	
	 provide assistance to survivors without reference to immigration status; 
	 communicate emergency and relief information in multiple languages and through 

means that will reach noncitizens; 

3405 (2013).
114   the mcic seeks to improve the capacity of states and diverse stakeholders to address the often unique 
challenges and hardships faced by migrants in situations of crisis and to develop non-binding voluntary 
guidelines to enhance protection and assistance to noncitizens in these circumstances (weerasinghe et al. 
2015, 30, 48).
115   these crises were the libyan uprising that led to muammar gaddafis overthrow; the tohoku 
earthquake, tsunami, and fukushima nuclear accident in japan; hurricane sandy in the northeastern united 
states; flooding in thailand; and the barbaric conflict in syria.

facilitate  departure  in  the  aftermath  of  crises  and  expedite  re-entry  by  rapidly 
processing visa and return applications; 
target relief to noncitizens; 
intervene  to  address  the  particular  needs  of  their  citizens  in  crisis  situations, 
including by seeking external assistance; and
legalize migrant workers and create channels to allow (other) noncitizens to return 
safely to their countries of origin (ibid., 47-8). 

c. child migrants from mexico and central america

between  fy  2011  and  fy  2014,  the  number  of  unaccompanied  alien  children  (uac) 
arrested  by  us  border  officials  rose  from  16,056  to  68,541  (unhcr  2014b,  16;  cbp 
2015).116 arrivals  of  uac  from  mexico  were  consistently  high  throughout  this  period 
(cbp 2015). however, uac migration increased dramatically between fy 2009 and fy 
2014  from  el  salvador  (1,221  to  16,404),  guatemala  (1,115  to  17,057),  and  honduras 
(968 to 18,244) (cbp 2015). in addition, these figures fail to reflect the full extent of child 
migration from the northern triangle nations because some uac were arrested in transit 
to the united states, others eluded arrest by us border officials, and a large number of 
young children arrived with a parent, typically their mothers. between fy 2013 and fy 
2014, the number of persons arrested in family units rose from 14,855 to 68,445, with 
34,495 in fy 2014 coming from honduras alone (cbp 2015). 
uac and families do not migrate only to the united states. in fact, the number of us 
asylum claims filed by central americans from the northern triangle states has been low 
in relation to the apparent scale of internal displacement (cantor 2014, 27). individuals 
and families initially search for nearby support networks; thereafter there is some internal 
displacement to other areas more distant from the place of origin; and finally in some cases 
borders are crossed (cidehum and unhcr 2012, 15). 
gang-related violence constitutes a pervasive threat for children. central american gangs 
have roughly 70,000 members and there are 4.5 million unregistered firearms in the region, 
the vast majority trafficked from north america (cidehum and unhcr 2012, 11, note 
3). organized crime, which is concentrated in border areas and urban centers, has caused 
a weakening of state structures, with negative consequences for the ability of central 
american  states  to  protect  their  citizens  (ibid.,  13).  gangs  target  socially  marginalized 
persons and those who have resisted their activities, including young men and boys who 
refuse recruitment, young women and adolescent girls who refuse sexual demands and 
enlistment, and business owners who do not meet extortion and other demands (unhcr 
2014b, 96). the national and international protection response to organized crime in the 
northern triangle states has been ineffective (cidehum and unhcr 2012, 6). 
gang recruitment and violence drive child migration from northern triangle states and 
mexico (cidehum and unhcr 2012, 19, 22, 25; albuja 2014, 27; carlson and gallagher 
2015, 133-34). yet despite the worlds highest homicide rates outside war zones, honduran, 
salvadoran, and guatemalan gang-related asylum claims have faced numerous hurdles in 

116   unaccompanied alien children are defined as children under age 18 who lack immigration status and 
have no parent or legal guardian who will or can care for or take physical custody of them. 

240

journal on migration and human securityimmigration courts. courts generally hold that gangs are motivated by the desire to increase 
membership and secure wealth and power, rather than by the victims political opinions, 
social group, or religious convictions. thus, claims predicated exclusively on resistance 
to gang recruitment or refusal to join a gang almost always fail (carlson and gallagher 
2015, 146-47). however, claims based on membership in a family whose members have 
been persecuted often succeed, as do claims of former gang members (ibid.). 
the consequences of a negative asylum determination for unaccompanied children and 
young mothers with children can be severe. uac who are deported after emigrating in 
search of their parents and female heads of households with young children are among the 
most vulnerable groups to gang predation (cidehum and unhcr 2012, 29). 
some members of congress attributed the increase in child migration to the united states 
over the last five years to the trafficking victims reauthorization act of 2008 (tvpra), 
and argued that fast-track removal processes should be applied to children from central 
america. the tvpra requires uac to be screened to determine if they have been victims 
of trafficking or have a credible fear of persecution. however, it treats unaccompanied 
children from contiguous and non-contiguous states differently. children from mexico and 
canada are screened by border officials and, if found not to fear persecution or not to 
have been victims of trafficking, face an expedited process of removal via withdrawal 
of their applications. children from non-contiguous states are placed in normal removal 
proceedings, hardly lenient treatment. 
as  carlson  and  gallagher  point  out,  us  asylum  and  immigration  law  generally  treat 
children like adults; the best interests standard does not apply,117 with an exception for 
unaccompanied  children  in  orr  custody  who  must  be  placed  in  the  least  restrictive 
setting that is in the best interest of the child.118  

policy proposals

the dramatic rise in arrivals of central american youth in 2014 and the consistently high 
numbers of mexican youth migrating to the united states in recent years illustrate the 
overriding need to address the structural causes of forced migration through social reform, 
economic development, rule of law initiatives, and humanitarian programs. in response to a 
culture of impunity, there is an acute need to create strong legal institutions and to promote 
the rule of law (cidehum and unhcr 2012, 15). high rates of child migration also 
illustrate the need for immigration reform that permits the reunification of children with 
their long-term us resident parents. donato and sisk find that the migration of children is 
strongly connected to the migration history of their parents and, in particular, the separation 
of children from their us resident parents (donato and sisk 2015). 
carlson and gallagher oppose changes in the law that would apply the fast-track removal 
process  to  unaccompanied  children  from  non-contiguous  states.  they  query  whether 

117   best interests is a subjective standardfor which there is no one definitionrelied upon in making 
decisions regarding a childs well-being, typically involving custody, living arrangements, and other 
important issues. best interest processes prioritize the childs participation and perspective.
118   8 usc 232(c)(2). 

241

the us refugee protection systemimmigration officials can fairly and competently screen children from contiguous states 
(mexico) to determine if they have been trafficked or fear persecution. in addition, they 
propose that cbp officialsunarmed and in civilian clothesshould be paired with child 
welfare experts or ngo personnel during screening (carlson and gallagher 2015, 151). 
in the alternative, they argue that uscis asylum officers should conduct this screening. 
they also argue that the best interest of the child standard should be incorporated into all 
decision-making related to children. 
the border security, economic opportunity, and immigration modernization act would 
have required that consideration be given to the best interests of the child in decisions 
related  to  the  repatriation  of  parents  or  their  referral  for  prosecution,  and  on  detention 
decisions related to parents and primary caregivers.119 

4. due process issues

a. legal representation

us removal proceedings can be difficult to negotiate without legal representation for even 
the most informed and sophisticated noncitizens and particularly for asylum seekers. yet 
45 percent of persons whose cases were completed by an immigration judge in fy 2014 
lacked legal representation (eoir 2015, f1).  as table 2 reveals, representation rates of 
detained and non-detained persons vary significantly. between fy 2010 and fy 2014, the 
rates of represented non-detainees ranged from 70 to 78 percent.  in contrast, representation 
rates of detainees increased from 14 percent in fy 2010 to 27 percent in fy 2013 and fy 
2014.  however, the actual number of represented detainees fell substantially from fy 
2011 to fy 2014, which can be attributed (in part) to the diminishing numbers of detainees 
that receive a hearing before an immigration judge.

detention  and  the  resulting  inability  to  work  also  decreases  the  likelihood  that  asylum 
seekers can secure legal representation, which negatively affects their ability to present 
their  claims  and  to  obtain  asylum  (kerwin  2005b;  katzmann  2008;  ramji-nogales,

242

journal on migration and human securityschoenholtz, and schrag 2009). legal representation, on the other hand, has the potential 
to contribute substantially to the efficiency of immigration court proceedings, ensure better 
prepared cases, and save court and detention costs (montgomery 2014).

policy proposals

the refugee protection act of 2013 would have given the attorney general (or his or her 
designee) the authority to appoint counsel in removal proceedings if the fair resolution or 
effective adjudication of the proceedings would be served by appointment of counsel.120 it 
would also have expanded government-funded legal orientation programs for detainees.121 
the border security, economic opportunity, and immigration modernization act would 
have required that legal orientation programs be provided to all detainees within five days 
of being taken into custody; would have allowed immigration judges to appoint counsel in 
removal proceedings at the governments expense; and would have mandated appointment 
of counsel to uacs, persons with serious mental disabilities, and the particularly vulnerable 
in order to ensure fair resolution and efficient adjudication.122
carlson and gallagher also argue for court appointed counsel and expansion of federally-
funded  legal  orientation  programs  due  to  the  complexity  of  us  immigration  law  and 
procedure and the immense stakes for children and families facing removal. the border 
security,  economic  opportunity,  and  immigration  modernization act  would  also  have 
allowed applicants at overseas refugee interviews to be represented, at no expense to the 
government, by attorneys, or federally-accredited representatives.123

b. insufficient court and adjudicatory resources

for many years, eoirs relatively modest funding levels$312 million in fy 2014 and 
$347 million in fy 2015 (doj 2015)have been totally insufficient to meet the demands 
of  the  large,  complex  caseload  generated  by  the  us  immigration  enforcement  system 
whose two largest enforcement agencies alone receive in excess of $18 billion annually 
(dhs 2014a, 7). eoirs 260 immigration judges cannot keep pace with incoming cases, 
much less make headway against a backlog of 449,001 cases as of june 2015, which had 
been pending an average of 612 days (trac 2015).124

these delays prolong the separation of asylum seekers from their family members, who 
remain abroad often at great risk (hrf 2015). they also make it more difficult to corroborate 
claims, secure counsel, and (thus) prevail in asylum claims (ibid.). furthermore, they create 
a perverse incentive for asylum seekers to remain in detention because of the expedited 
court docket for detainees (ibid.). carlson and gallagher describe the desperate need for 
additional resources to uscis and to eoir for adjudication of asylum claims. 
while immigration court delays are more widely recognized, applications to the uscis 
asylum office can take up to two years in some cases (carlson and gallagher 2015, 151). 
as of march 2014, the affirmative asylum backlog had increased to 45,193 due, in part, to 
deployment of asylum officers to the under-resourced and growing number of credible 
fear and reasonable fear interviews (hrf 2014).

policy proposals

in a comprehensive 2010 report on the removal adjudication system, the american bar 
association  (aba)  commission  on  immigration  characterized  the  immigration  court 
system as underfunded and understaffed in all areas and called for more immigration 
judges, law clerks and other support staff (aba 2010, 2-36). compared to social security 
administration administrative law judges that are expected to issue 500 to 700 legally 
sufficient  decisions  per  year,  immigration  judges  are  responsible  for  more  than  1,000 
decisions annually (ibid., 2-37). the aba recommended that congress appropriate funding 
for an additional 100 immigration judges, as well as at least one law clerk per judge, over 
a three-to-four-year period (ibid., 2-38). 
eoirs  fy  2016  budget  request  would  substantially  increase  funding  for  immigration 
judges and related staff. it provides for an additional 55 immigration judges and an increase 
in funding from $347 to $482 million (doj 2015). after years of underfunding, neglect, 

244

journal on migration and human securityand weathering various internal and external crises, eoir will need further increases in 
immigration judges and related staff over several years. human rights first, for example, 
has called for an additional 275 to 300 immigration judge teams over the next three years 
(hrf  2015).  congress  should  also  substantially  increase  funding  to  uscis  for  more 
asylum officers in order to reduce delays in the adjudication of affirmative claims. 

c. competence and professionalism of immigration officials and 

adjudicators 
the literature on refugee protection is rife with reports of federal officials who erroneously 
deny protection due to the misuse of their positions, inadequate training, or incompetence. 
immigration officials at the us-mexico border, for example, often try to dissuade persons 
from  seeking  asylum  or  mischaracterize  their  statements  (pistone  and  hoeffner  2006, 
182-83; uscirf 2005b, 15-20), leading immigration judges to deny their asylum claims 
on credibility grounds (cabot 2014, 365-66, 371-73; uscirf 2005a, 57). immigration 
judges who live and work on the us-mexico border often rely on their own passing and 
incomplete knowledge of conditions in mexico to impeach and deny asylum claims (cabot 
2014, 373).125 some immigration judges also reject mexican claims under the convention 
against torture in the mistaken belief that public officials cannot acquiesce to torture 
if some government officials oppose or seek to prevent torture, while others perpetrate it 
(ibid., 370).126 
carlson  and  gallagher  also  fault  cbp  for  providing  insufficient  screening  of  mexican 
children at the border and a presumption by cbp officers of the absence of a protection 
need (carlson and gallagher 2015, 138). 

policy proposals

to  address  these  problems,  cabot  proposes  that  immigration  judges  be  deliberately 
and  thoughtfully  educated  on  country  conditions  so  that  incomplete  and  inaccurate 
information  is not the context for their decision making (cabot 2014, 373). carlson 
and  gallagher  also  argue  for  greater  training  and  oversight  of  immigration  judges  and 
border officials.

iv. conclusion
the papers in this collection examine the legal, policy, and programmatic infrastructure 
of  the  us  refugee  protection  system,  which  has  extended  protectionon  a  permanent, 
indefinite, and temporary basisto several million persons since passage of the refugee 
act of 1980. they set forth policy proposals that address egregious problems in the law, 
its interpretation, and its implementation, including the denial of access to us territory to 
persons at risk of persecution and torture, procedural bars to protection, security-related 

125   these problems are not exclusive to the united states. other states and international institutions have 
been slow to address the protection gaps created by organized criminal predation (cidehum and unhcr 
2012, 27).

ability to admit imperiled non-refugees. 
in  passing  the  refugee  act  of  1980,  congress  recognized  the  historic  policy  of  the 
united states to respond to the urgent needs of persons subject to persecution through 
humanitarian assistance, resettlement, and voluntary return,127 and encouraged all nations 
to assist in pursuing these ends to the fullest extent possible.128 the united states should 
renew its commitment to these goals by, in part, adopting the reforms proposed in this 
collection.  
over the last 35 years, it has also become increasingly evident that the united states should 
invest more heavily in the prevention of forced displacement, assistance to refugees and 
refugee-like populations in their host communities, initiatives to maximize the contributions 
of refugees in their communities of origin and destination, and the creation of conditions 
that permit their voluntary return. to accomplish these goals, the constituent parts of the us 
refugee protection system must better integrate with each other; yawning gaps in protection 
must be filled; the systems work must be embedded within a larger set of diplomatic, 
economic development, rule of law and human security strateges; and the united states 
must effectively engage other states, regional bodies, and international institutions. and all 
of this work must be founded on notions of human security and dignity (helton 2000, 83), 
and build on the agency, aspirations, and rights of those at the heart of this phenomenon.
