policies can strengthen human 
and national security

executive summary
this paper makes the case that refugee protection and national security 
should be viewed as complementary, not conflicting state goals. it argues 
that refugee protection can further the security of refugees, affected states, 
and  the  international  community.  refugees  and  international  migrants 
can also advance national security by contributing to a states economic 
vitality,  military  strength,  diplomatic  standing,  and  civic  values.  the 
paper  identifies  several  strategies  that  would,  if  implemented,  promote 
both security and refugee protection. it also outlines additional steps that 
the us congress should take to enhance us refugee protection policies and 
security. finally, it argues for the efficacy of political engagement in support 
of pro-protection, pro-security policies, and against the assumption that 
political populism will invariably impede support for refugee protection.

i. introduction
from its genesis in the debates of medieval canon lawyers, the concept of subjective human 
rights, including the right to self-preservation, has been premised on the idea of the moral 
equality of persons buttressed by a zone of human autonomy that permits the free exercise 
of rights (siedentrop 2014, 245-46; tierney 1997, 83-89). these intuitions ultimately gave 
rise, following the great upheaval of world war ii, to a series of seminal human rights 
instruments that vested in states, individually and collectively, the core responsibility to 
defend human dignity, rights, and security. 
refugees and other forcibly displaced persons have fled violence, persecution and other 
untenable situations.1 the overwhelming majority seeks a level of protection and security 

1   a refugee is a person who owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, 
nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his or her 
nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that 
country. convention relating to the status of refugees (geneva, 28 july 1951) 189 u.n.t.s. 137, entered 
into force 22 april 1954 [the refugee convention]; protocol relating to the status of refugees (new york, 
31 jan. 1967) 606 u.n.t.s. 267, entered into force 4 oct. 1967  [the refugee protocol]. the term forcibly 
displaced refers to refugees, asylum seekers (seeking refugee status in host states), and internally displaced 
persons (idps) (unhcr 2015a). as used in this paper, the term refugee protection denotes more than the 
rights afforded refugees under the refugee convention and protocol: it refers to the range of policies and 
programs to prevent and respond to forcible displacement.

include persons with a mix of motives (some dangerous) and aspirations (some illiberal). 
states have a responsibility to prevent terrorist incursions and attacks: they exist, in part, 
to protect the lives and rights of their residents. however, they also have a responsibility 
to protect members of other states who are fleeing persecution and violence. in public 
and political discourse, refugees are often treated as a threat to national security and, in 
particular, as a source and conduit for terrorism. however, robust refugee protection policies 
do not cause and need not exacerbate the threat of terrorism. in fact, they can diminish it.
this paper addresses the intersection of refugee protection and national security, which 
should  be  conceived  of  as  complementary,  not  competing,  imperatives.  it  makes  the 
case that: (1) refugee protection can advance both human and state security; (2) refugees 
and forcibly displaced persons can contribute to a states vitality, economic well-being, 
diversity, core values, and military strength; and (3) refugee protection and national security 
strategies largely align. 
refugee protection and national security respond to the aspiration for human security, albeit 
from different perspectives and with different emphases. national security underscores the 
responsibility of states to protect the lives and safeguard the rights of their residents, while 
refugee protection speaks to the responsibility of states  individually and collectively  
to defend the rights of persons who are at risk of persecution, either by their own states or 
by groups that their states cannot or will not control. national security also encompasses 
the protection of a states economic vitality and fundamental values, including those values 
reflected in its commitments under domestic and international law.  
a substantial body of literature has examined the nexus between international migration 
and terrorism (adamson 2006; leiken and brooks 2006; kerwin and stock 2007; martin 
2009; ginsburg 2006; and 2010), but there has been less scholarship on the relationships 
between refugee protection and national security (koser and cunningham 2015; schmid 
2016). that said, these two bodies of literature overlap, as do the lines between refugees 
and international migrants,2 and between national security and counterterrorism.3 
this  paper  builds  on  the  paradigm  described  by  susan  ginsburg  as  securing  human 
mobility (ginsburg 2010), which speaks to the need for refugee- and migration-related 
security  measures  that  go  beyond  default  border  control  and  immigration  enforcement 
strategies. this framework recognizes the need to replace large-scale irregular flight with 
orderly,  legal  migration;  to  secure  migration  channels  and  infrastructure;  to  safeguard 
migrants in transit; to maximize the benefits of migration to all stakeholders in this process; 
and to foil terrorists, traffickers, and members of organized criminal groups.
after  this  introduction,  the  paper  begins  by  describing,  in  section  ii,  the  causes  and 

2  international migration refers to the movement of persons across national borders. the united nations 
(un) defines an international migrant as a person living outside his or her country of birth (un desa 
2016, 4). in 2015, there were roughly 244 million international migrants (ibid.).
3   the us national security agenda identifies a range of priorities under the categories of security, prosperity, 
values and international order (white house 2015b). combating the threat of terrorism constitutes one of 
eight priorities under the security rubric.

journal on migration and human securitycatastrophic dimensions of the global refugee crisis.4 its third section outlines two of the 
papers main themes; i.e., that refugee protection can further the security of refugees, affected 
states, and the international community, and that refugees and international migrants can 
advance national security by contributing to a states economic vitality, military strength, 
diplomatic standing, and civic values. 
section iv examines the scope of the global terrorist threat, and the potential nexus between 
refugees, migrants, and terrorists. it concludes that terrorist violence leads to refugee flows 
and that robust screening can substantially diminish the risk of entry by terrorists posing 
as refugees. 
section v evaluates us migration-related security strategies following the september 11, 
2011 attacks. this section describes the need for effective intelligence collection, information 
sharing, identity assurance, and strategies that promote national unity. it compares the us 
response to muslim americans and immigrants following the 9/11 attacks, with proposals 
to suspend the admission of muslims and kill the families of terrorists. it also describes 
failed and misguided us security strategies and its overemphasis on us-mexico border 
security.
section vi describes the rigorous vetting and screening built into the us refugee resettlement 
system, and contrasts the us system with europes patchwork of migration-related security 
measures, which has exacerbated the vulnerability of european states to terrorist attacks. 
section  vii  offers  three  sets  of  policy  recommendations.  the  first  set  starts  from  the 
premise that security and refugee protection reflect a common aspiration for human safety 
and well-being and that the primary refugee protection strategies promote national security, 
including strategies:

 

 
 

 
 

to  address  refugee  producing  conditions  through  conflict  prevention,  mediation, 
and resolution; 
to strengthen the rule of law in refugee sending communities;
to provide development and humanitarian assistance to the communities that host 
the vast majority of the worlds refugees and forcibly displaced persons; 
to create conditions that permit the safe and voluntary return of refugees; and 
to screen refugees and migrants seeking entry to potential host countries. 

the second set of recommendations outlines steps that the us congress should take to 
enhance national security and refugee protection. these speak to improved congressional 
oversight  and  governance  of  the  us  department  of  homeland  security  (dhs),  the 
establishment  of  a  us  coordinator  for  refugee  affairs,  measures  to  prevent  bona  fide 
terrorists from purchasing firearms and explosives, and the need to depoliticize the us 
refugee resettlement program. the third argues for the efficacy of political engagement in 
support of pro-protection, pro-security policies. 

4   the paper uses the term refugee crisis to describe the international communitys failure to anticipate 
and respond effectively to refugee-producing conditions, the failure of responsibility sharing in meeting the 
needs and fostering the talents of refugees, and the massive human crisis that has resulted from these twin 
failures.

refugee protection policies and national securityii. the global refugee crisis: causes, consequences, and 
response 
at  65.3  million,  the  worlds  forcibly  displaced  population  roughly  equals  in  size  the 
number of persons uprooted by world war ii and its aftermath (unhcr 2016; proudfoot 
1956).  moreover,  the  tenacity  of  the  worlds  refugee-producing  situations,  the  lack  of 
progress in developing viable and permanent solutions for protracted refugees,5 and the 
regular emergence of new refugee-producing situations mean that this crisis will continue 
to intensify, absent a coordinated and generous global response (nordland 2015).

as these situations reveal, if states do not successfully address 

the causes of refugee flows, they will invariably face the 
herculean task of responding to their human consequences

the  worlds  spiraling  refugee-producing  crises  reflect  the  failure  of  states  to  forego, 
prevent, and stem armed conflict, civil war, terrorism, and breakdowns in the rule of law 
(unhcr  2015a,  5).  refugee-producing  conflicts  have  regularly  erupted  or  reignited 
and long-term crises drag on with no solutions in sight.6 in october 2015, former united 
nations high commissioner for refugees antnio guterres spoke of the worlds shrinking 
humanitarian space, resulting from the interlinked mega-crises in syria and iraq and the 
displacement within the preceding year of 1.1 million yemenis, 500,000 south sudanese, 
190,000 burundians, and tens of thousands of bangladeshis, stateless ethnic rohingya, 
central america children, and refugees from the central african republic (car), nigeria, 
ukraine,  and  the  democratic  republic  of  congo  (drc)  (unhcr  2015d).    in august 
2016,  the  office  of  the  united  nations  high  commissioner  for  refugees  (unhcr) 
reported that 1.6 million south sudanese were internally displaced and 930,000 had fled to 
the surrounding nations of uganda, sudan, drc, car, ethiopia, and kenya, with more 
arriving daily (un news centre 2016). un officials lament a vast arc of crisis which 
extends from southwest asia through the middle east to the horn of africa and the lake 
chad basin.7 as these situations reveal, if states do not successfully address the causes 
of refugee flows, they will invariably face the herculean task of responding to their human 
consequences. 
the global refugee crisis can also be attributed, in part, to the finely honed strategies of 
developed states to deny access to protection through border externalization,8 immigration 
5   unhcr defines protracted refugees as those who have been displaced for five years or more and have no 
immediate prospects for durable solutions.

intent and, often, the letter of international law (schoenholtz 2015, 86-90; hathaway and 
gammeltoft-hansen 2014).9 border externalization strategies place the onus of refugee 
protection on less developed states in proximity to crises (unga 2016  112). they also 
force refugees to take perilous journeys, contribute to a public conception of refugees as a 
threat and burden, and bolster human trafficking syndicates (unhcr 2015c). 
one-half  of  the  worlds  refugees  are  children  (unhcr  2016,  8),  and  their  treatment 
can  be  particularly  callous.  since  2014,  for  example,  mexicos  immigration  agency, 
instituto nacional de migracin, has intercepted tens of thousands of central american 
unaccompanied children and families with young children who are fleeing some of the 
worlds most violent communities.10 however, it has failed to inform most of those children 
of  their  right  to  seek  recognition  as  refugees,  to  screen  or  question  them  for  potential 
refugee claims, or to offer them legal assistance (hrw 39-56, 71-73). it has also detained, 
deterred and effectively prevented many children from pursuing refugee claims in violation 
of mexican and international law (ibid., 57-64). 
the united states has underwritten mexicos interception and detention program, while 
doing little to ensure screening and protection for those fleeing from violence and persecution 
in central america and elsewhere. the united states has also built and populated its own 
vast family detention centers (usccb/mrs and cms 2015, 164). 
the global refugee crisis can also be blamed on public indifference and insufficient state 
responsibility  sharing  in  the  form  of  traditional  durable  solutions  and  legal  migration 
opportunities for refugees (unhcr 2015d).11 like other human rights conventions, the 
refugee convention does not set forth a precise balance of responsibility between states 
or offer a blueprint for every contingency, but it recognizes refugee protection as a shared 
responsibility that should be addressed in a spirit of generosity and cooperation (goodwin-
gill 2003, 25).  
the preamble to the 1951 refugee convention acknowledges that because asylum may 
place unduly heavy burdens on certain countries, a satisfactory solution to refugees 
cannot be achieved without international co-operation.12 former united nations high 
commissioner for refugees antonio guterres argued that nations that host large numbers 
of  refugees    thus  producing  a  global  public  good    deserve  particular  focus  for 
humanitarian, equitable, and security reasons:  

many of these states are crucial pillars of peace and stability in their regions, and 
with conflicts and terrorism threatening to spill across borders, they de facto form 
the first line of defense for our collective security.

refugee protection policies and national securityyet the worlds response to the communities that host large-scale refugee populations and 
that bear the burden for multiple humanitarian crises has been dismal. only 35 percent 
of the needs of un programs in africa, for example, have been met,13 and unhcr has 
received only 20 percent of the funding needed for the south sudanese refugee crisis (un 
news centre 2016).
the  refugee  act  of  1980,  which  established  the  us  refugee  admissions  program 
(usrap),  locates  resettlement  within  a  broader  protection  response  that  includes 
humanitarian assistance and voluntary repatriation.14 in fact, most refugees want to 
return home and there is a growing consensus among states that repatriation constitutes the 
only feasible solution for the vast majority of refugees (long 2013  21, 197). however, 
the  international  community  has  failed  to  devote  the  level  of  resources  or  systematic 
engagement  necessary  to  prevent  refugee-producing  conflicts,  to  mediate  disputes,  to 
engage difficult peace processes, or to create the conditions that would permit the safe 
return of refugees and other forcibly displaced persons. as a result, only 126,800 refugees 
were voluntarily repatriated in 2014, the smallest number in 30 years (unhcr 2015a, 8)15 
and 201,400 in 2015 (unhcr 2016), the third lowest number in 20 years (ibid., 25).16 
these figures call into question safe, voluntary repatriation as a continued pillar of the 
global refugee protection system. 
moreover, repatriation and other durable solutions are less likely for the growing numbers 
of persons that have been displaced for extended periods (unga 2016  17; wef 2016, 
15). by the end of 2015, 6.7 million refugees lived in protracted situations; that is, they 
had been displaced for at least five years and had no immediate prospects of repatriation, 
incorporation into host communities, or third-country resettlement (unhcr 2016, 8).17 
the  average  protracted  refugee  situation  has  lasted  26  years  (ibid.,  20).  some  refugee 
camps and urban settings are now home to a third generation of displaced persons (unga 
2016  2), including the 1.6 million afghani refugees in pakistan.18 
although  less  than  1  percent  of  refugees  are  ultimately  resettled  in  third-countries 
(dos 2015a), this option complements other durable solutions like safe repatriation and 
integration into host communities. unhcr conservatively projected that 960,000 refugees 
would need to be resettled in 2015 (unhcr 2014a, 9), but it referred only 134,000 cases 
for resettlement and only 107,100 refugees departed to a third-country, with 90 percent 
resettled in the united states, canada, and australia (unhcr 2016, 26). 
for  some  refugees,  third-country  resettlement  constitutes  their  only  viable  option.  us

journal on migration and human securityrefugee  resettlement  priority  cases  fit  within  this  category.  former  dhs  secretaries 
janet napolitano and michael chertoff describe the refugees eligible for resettlement in 
the united states as the most vulnerable  particularly survivors of violence and torture, 
those with severe medical conditions, and women and children.19 this population also 
includes persons at risk because they worked with americans and us institutions in iraq 
and afghanistan.20 
the failure of states to protect can be seen starkly in the syrian civil war and the humanitarian 
disaster that has emanated from it. now in its sixth year, the war has claimed an estimated 
400,000 lives, and includes a dizzying array of participants, including global and regional 
powers, the assad regime, the islamic state of iraq and the levant (isil), the al-nusra 
front (which primarily seeks an islamic state in syria), and a large number of brigades and 
gangs that vie for control over small areas.
an estimated 13.5 million persons in syria need humanitarian aid, 6.5 million are internally 
displaced, and 4.5 million live in besieged or hard-to-reach regions (european commission 
2016). the syrian crisis has convulsed the middle east, exhausted the resources of syrias 
neighbors, shaken the foundations of the european union (eu), led to thousands of migrant 
deaths, 21 and become a global catastrophe. by august 2016, 4.81 million syrians had been 
registered as refugees or were awaiting registration in turkey (2.72 million), lebanon (1.03 
million), jordan (656,198), iraq (249,395), and egypt (114,911), with smaller numbers in 
north africa (3rp 2016).22 these five nations have a combined gdp of $1.4 trillion, or 
$1.1 trillion (if egypt is excluded).23 their combined population is roughly 220 million or 
128.5 million, excluding egypt (un desa 2015, 14-17).24 in comparison, the us gdp is 
$17.4 trillion (world bank 2015), and its population is 321.8 million (un desa 2015, 17).
the international community has a strong interest in an effective, coordinated response 
to the syrian refugee crisis, but state contributions to international institutions and direct 
support have been decidedly unequal to the need. by the end of january 2016, the united 
nations had received only 61 percent of its $4.3 billion humanitarian appeal for syrian

21    the  international  organization  for  migration  (iom)  reports  that  5,600  migrants  perished  in  2015, 
including 3,765 in the mediterranean (iom 2016). iom records only deaths reported by the united nations, 
state, media and non-government organizations (ngos). these figures significantly understate actual migrant 
deaths. during the first eight months of 2016, the pace of migrant deaths increased compared to the same 
period in 2015, with a higher concentration of deaths in the mediterranean. 
22   since the beginning of the october 2015 military offensive by the syrian arab army, 137,802 have been 
displaced from aleppo, idleb, hama, and homs (echo 2016).  
23   the gdps of the states hosting the overwhelming majority of syrian refugees are, respectively, turkey 
($800 billion), egypt ($287 billion), iraq ($221 billion), lebanon ($46 billion), and jordan ($36 billion) 
(world bank 2015). 
24   the populations of the states hosting the most syrian refugees are turkey (78.7 million), lebanon (5.8 
million), jordan (7.6 million), iraq (36.4 million) and egypt (91.5 million) (un desa 2015, 14-17).

refugee protection policies and national securityrefugees  for  2015.25  funding  shortfalls,  in  turn,  have  contributed  to  crises  in  refugee 
housing, health care, food, water, sanitation, education, and reception. the high rate of 
syrian refugee girls forced into marriages starkly reflects the level of desperation among 
refugees (save the children 2014, 3-5; unicef 2014, 27). the girls parents often view 
marriage as the only way available to support their families, protect their daughters, or 
otherwise escape their predicament (ibid.). 
condemned to marginal, insecure, and provisional lives in host states, hundreds of thousands 
of syrians and other refugees have embarked on perilous journeys to europe (mahecic 
2016; grant 2015), overwhelming the screening capacity of greece and italy. the resulting 
crisis has undermined support for the schengen agreements passport-free movement of 
residents within participating eu states, and eroded confidence in the ability of eu states 
to work in solidarity to address common challenges. drastic cuts in food aid to refugees 
by the underfunded un world food programme, the prospect of asylum in europe, and 
diminishing  hopes  that  the assad  regime  will  be  replaced  have  also  contributed  to  the 
onward migration of syrians from neighboring states (schmid 2016, 47).
as a result of these and other developments, the number of first-time asylum applicants 
in the eu-28 reached 1.26 million in 2015, with 29 percent from syria (eurostat 2016).26 
germany  alone  registered  1.1  million  first-time  asylum-seekers  in  2015  (pandy  2016), 
more than one-third from syria. overall, between april 2011 and march 2016, more than 
one million syrian asylum applications were filed in european nations (3rp 2016). 
in a slightly shorter time period between 2012 and 2015, the united states granted asylum 
to 242 syrians in immigration court and to an unreported (but modest) number of syrians 
who  made  affirmative  asylum  claims  to  us  citizenship  and  immigration  services 
(uscis)  (doj  2016).  the  united  states  has  also  extended  temporary  protected  status 
(tps) to roughly 5,800 syrians and an additional 2,500 may be able to apply under the 
most recent tps redesignation (dinan 2016). tps confers a reprieve from removal and 
work authorization for designated nationals who arrived before a designated date (bergeron 
2014, 25), in this case march 29, 2012.27 subsequently, dhs has redesignated syria for 
tps three times, most recently on august 1, 2016 (uscis 2016). unlike an extension 
of tps, a redesignation covers nationals of designated states who arrive after the earlier 
designation and redesignation dates (kerwin 2014, 57). 

25   between fy 2012 and fy 2015, the united states contributed $4.53 billion in humanitarian funding for 
syrians, including $2.1 billion from the us department of states (doss) bureau of population, refugees 
and migration (prm), $1.6 billion from us agency for international development (usaid), office of food 
for peace, and $866 million through the usaid office of foreign disaster assistance (usaid 2015). it 
committed to contribute an additional $600 million in aid at the february 4, 2016 london donors conference 
(echo 2016). the eu and its member states have contributed 5 billion for relief and humanitarian aid in 
syria, lebanon, jordan, iraq, turkey and egypt, and pledged an additional 3 billion at the donors conference 
in london (ibid.).
26   in stark contrast, the gulf cooperation council states  qatar, united arab emirates, saudi arabia, 
kuwait, bahrain, and oman  failed to resettle any syrian refugees between the wars onset and late 2015 
(amnesty 2015). 
27   because it does not lead to lawful permanent resident status and typically extends well beyond the initial 
designation period, tps has been criticized for locking beneficiaries into a legal limbo that does not lead 
to permanent protection or integration (bergeron 2014, 29).

journal on migration and human securitywhile  the  united  states  has  accepted  roughly  70  percent  of  all  unhcr-submitted 
refugees for resettlement in recent years (unhcr 2014a, 61; unhcr 2015b, 53), from 
the beginning of fy 2012 through september 6, 2016, the united states admitted 12,910 
syrians for resettlement,28 which is roughly one-fourth of 1 percent of syrian refugees. its 
admission of 11,056 syrian refugees in slightly more than eleven months of fy 2016,29 
exceeds its fy 2016 goal of 10,000 syrian admissions (dos, dhs, and hhs 2015, iv).  

iii. refugee protection: a potential source of security 
security-related  fears  do  not  constitute  the  only  barrier  to  generous  refugee  policies. 
concerns over social cohesion, social order, native employment and economic prospects 
also underlie anti-refugee sentiment. large-scale refugee admissions have never enjoyed 
high levels of public support in the united states (desilver 2015). yet in recent years 
refugee-related terrorism concerns have been particularly tenacious in the united states, 
europe, kenya, and elsewhere, contributing to the backlash against refugees and the uneven 
and parsimonious response to the global refugee crisis. 

refugee protection and legal migration policies can also 
further the rule-of-law by minimizing irregular migration, 
curbing the use of human smugglers, limiting the risk of 
trafficking, and making life more difficult for terrorists who

depend upon and often profit from smuggling networks

refugee protection and national security are inextricably linked needs. both reflect a desire 
for safety and security. however, they approach this aspiration from different perspectives 
and have different emphases. refugee protection arises from an ethic of solidarity rooted 
in a belief in human dignity and equality. it reflects the enlightened self-interest of states in 
a stable and moral world, one in which peace and respect for human rights are pervasive 
and firmly rooted (helton 2002, 120). 
in its thick sense, national security refers to more than national defense and homeland 
security.  it  speaks  to  the  protection  of  a  people,  territory  and  way  of  life  (jordan  et 
al.  2009,  3-4).  it  is  not  an  end  in  itself,  but  a  means  to  preserve  a  nations  values, 
principles, and way of life (dhs 2010, v). it underscores a states responsibility to defend 
its members from foreign domination and to safeguard their rights at home and abroad, 
and also to uphold the rights of imperiled noncitizens at its borders, in transit through its 
territory, and (in extreme circumstances like genocide) in their states of origin.
states often use the language of security, crisis, and risk to justify harsh policy responses to 
refugees and other forcibly displaced persons. yet this language also points to the potential 
complementarity between security and refugee protection. conflict and terrorism create 
insecurity for their victims, for targeted and neighboring states, and for the international 
community. as a result, they require both security and protection responses.

refugee protection policies and national securitya  survey  of  750  experts  and  decision-makers  from  the  world  economic  forums 
(wefs) multistakeholder communities identified large-scale involuntary migration 
as  the  most  likely  global  risk  and  one  strongly  interconnected  with  other  risks  that 
are considered highly worrisome in the longer term, including state collapse, interstate 
conflict, climate change, and water crises (wef 2016, 6, 15).30 the survey identified the 
international refugee crisis as one of three risks that could give rise to cascading risks 
(ibid., 7). to address this crisis, the wefs report argued for a comprehensive response 
to interstate conflict and terrorist violence, as well as to the human insecurity caused by 
protracted refugee situations, ineffective integration, and inadequate global humanitarian 
architecture. (ibid., 15-16). in other words, its diagnosis (crisis and risk) led it to identify 
security and protection as complementary needs. 
michael chertoff holds a similar position on the need for integrated refugee protection and 
security strategies. in a june 2016 interview, he said:

[t]he sheer number of people moving not only puts those people themselves at 
risk in terms of their own security, but can cause a real dislocation in society  
you also dont want to have a situation where people are just stagnating in camps 
year in and year out because youre creating essentially a hospitable environment 
for people to recruit extremists and criminals. so i think youve got to look at the 
system end-to-end. part of that means dealing with countries that are failed states 
 where you do have war and you do have flight, you need to have a robust system 
for housing people, continuing to educate them, and processing them in a secure 
but reasonable timeframe. and frankly its enough of a global issue that it warrants 
the whole global community kicking in money to make sure that could be operated 
in an efficient way. and finally when people do qualify for asylum and are moved 
into host countries, there has to be a process in place to integrate them, get them 
educated, make sure they can find work so they become productive members of 
society and not simply embittered clusters of people who are marginalized.31 

rather than a threat, robust refugee protection and migration policies can positively influence 
three core areas of state power: economic, military and diplomatic (adamson 2006, 185). 
they can advance a states economic interests because in a globalized, interconnected world 
no nation can prosper, or even achieve modest economic success, without ready contact 
with the rest of the world (martin 2009, 4). in addition, they can help to meet labor needs 
(chamie 2013), improve the productivity and prospects of millions (clemens, montenegro, 
and pritchett 2008), and contribute to the development of source and destination nations  
(unga 2013). refugee protection and legal migration policies can also further the rule-of-
law by minimizing irregular migration, curbing the use of human smugglers, limiting the 
risk of trafficking, and making life more difficult for terrorists who depend upon and often 
profit from smuggling networks (ginsburg 2010, 58-65; schmid 2016, 27-29). 
refugees have historically made important economic, scientific, diplomatic, cultural, and 
ethical  contributions  to  their  new  states.  prominent  us  refugees  have  included albert 
30   it defined global risk as an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, can cause significant negative 
impact for several countries or industries within the next 10 years (wef 2016, 6).

the council on foreign relations independent task force on us immigration policy 
cautioned that to keep out talented immigrants or significantly disrupt legitimate cross-
border  traffic  or  commerce  would  weaken  the  long-term  foundations  of  americas 
economy and military strength, and consequently its security (cfr 2009, 21). noncitizens 
also serve in substantial and growing numbers in the us armed forces to which they bring 
lower attrition rates than citizens, a track record of superior performance and linguistic 
and cultural diversity that supports us counterterror objectives (hattiangadi et al. 2005, 
24, 55-67, 83, 87). 
the  un  2030  sustainable  development  goals  (sdg),  adopted  in  september  2015, 
recognized the importance of migration as a potential instrument of human and economic 
development by setting development targets related to the protection of labor rights, orderly 
and safe migration, and reduced remittance fees (unga 2015). the sdg migration-related 
targets speak to the need to channel what often begin as poorly managed, irregular refugee 
and migrant flows into legal migration and refugee protection systems that maximize the 
development potential of refugees, migrants, and source and destination communities.
from a foreign policy perspective, refugee protection can help states prevail in the battle 
of ideas, in a contest for the support and even the affection of the worlds population 
(martin 2009, 4). it can allow states to distinguish themselves from geopolitical rivals and 
to appeal to global public opinion.32 the us refugee program, for example, seeks to further 
the historic policy of the united states to respond to the urgent needs of persons subject to 
persecution in their homelands.33 it has also supported specific foreign policy objectives 
like protection of soviet jews and other religious minorities, while responding to domestic 
constituencies. resettlement can also promote the stability of allied states that host large 
refugee populations and, as illustrated by the 1989 comprehensive plan of action (cpa) 
concerning indochinese refugees, can preserve the availability of protection in nations of 
first asylum.34 
in the united states, refugees serve as a continuous, living reminder of the nations core 
values, including its commitment to religious liberty. and, as the obama administration has 
recognized, us success in promoting its security and values abroad turns on its adherence 
to its values at home (white house 2015b, 19). 
national  security  has  traditionally  been  defined  by  state  interests  or  collective  identity 
which,  in  the  post-westphalian  era,  has  been  based  on  nationalism  (adamson  2006, 

32   for an extended discussion of why national security concerns demand an appeal to global public opinion, 
see pistone and hoeffner (2011, 637-58, 674-76).

34   after  the  vietnam  war,  the  united  states  became  the  principal  architect  of  the  entire  resettlement 
system (suhrke 1998, 406, 413). its response offers a framework for a comprehensive, integrated response 
to large-scale refugee crises. together, the 1979 geneva conference which established the orderly departure 
program (odp) and the second geneva conference of june 1989 which adopted the comprehensive plan 
of action (cpa) provided for direct, legal departures from vietnam, temporary protection in nations of first 
asylum, and large-scale, third-country refugee resettlement. the cpa also provided for the repatriation of 
those not deemed to be refugees. not counting direct departures from vietnam under the odp, the united 
states took in 822,977 of the 1.3 million indochinese refugees resettled worldwide between 1979 and 1995 
(unhcr 2010, 99).

refugee protection policies and national security181). in a globalized world, international migration calls into question traditional models 
of national security, which assume a unitary national identity from which a set of national 
interests can be derived (ibid., 175).
refugees  and  migrants  can  also  make  crucial  contributions  to  the  struggle  against 
terrorism. indeed, following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, law enforcement and intelligence 
experts recognized the need to engage communities in which terrorists might attempt to 
hide, to draw on immigrants as a source of intelligence and support, and to enlist them 
in counterterror efforts (kerwin and stock 2007, 418-19). they insisted (correctly) that 
immigrant communities have a strong interest and incentive to cooperate in responding 
to a shared threat. not only do the members of these communities overwhelmingly reject 
extremist ideologies and terrorism, but they bear the brunt of hate crimes and vilification 
by anti-immigrant extremists following attacks. in fact, tips from community or family 
members helped to expose one-quarter of the 330 cases of persons charged with jihadist 
terrorist offenses in the united states since 9/11 (bergen 2016, 101-02). 

persons fleeing persecution and violence seek a degree 
of security denied them in their countries of origin, an 

aspiration that mirrors the desire for public safety 

by citizens in receiving communities

finally, it should be emphasized that the refugee convention does not apply to persons 
who have committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, 
a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge pre-admission, or have been 
guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the united nations.35 nor does 
the right to non-refoulement extend to a refugee who can reasonably be regarded as a 
danger to the security of the country in which he is, or who, having been convicted by a 
final judgment of a particularly serious crime, constitutes a danger to the community of 
that country.36 
a december 1, 2015 letter to the us congress from a group of former us diplomatic, 
intelligence, military, and homeland security officials  including madeleine albright, 
henry kissinger, david petraeus, and george schultz  made this point plainly, stating 
that refugees are victims, not perpetrators, of terrorism.37 one-half of the worlds refugees 
are  children,  large  numbers  have  survived  violence  and  torture,  and  many  have  severe 
or chronic medical conditions. persons fleeing persecution and violence seek a degree of 
security denied them in their countries of origin, an aspiration that mirrors the desire for 
public safety by citizens in receiving communities.

journal on migration and human securityiv. national security and the terrorist threat 
the term terrorism arose in response to the french revolutions reign of terror and was 
later used to describe state actors like the national socialist party and stalinist russia (aly 
2015, 85-86). in recent years, this phenomenon has become associated with violence against 
civilians or non-combatants by non-state actors. the global terrorism index produced by 
the institute for economics and peace defines terrorism as the threatened or actual use of 
illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or 
social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation (iep 2015, 6). commentators regularly 
characterize terrorism as a tactic, not an enemy or an ideology, an observation that doubled 
as a criticism of the open-ended nature of the us war on terrorism. this tactic is often 
adopted by non-state actors in asymmetric conflicts with states. 
the line between state and non-state terrorism can be blurred (wef 2016, 31). on the one 
hand, terrorist groups like isil, the revolutionary armed forces of colombia (farc), 
and al-shabaab, have assumed some of the responsibilities of states (glazzard 2015, 81). 
on the other hand, many states use terror as an instrument of repression, domination, and 
social control (schmid 2016, 14). for instance, the assad regime has terrorized syrians 
in rebel-held areas and other perceived opponents through the widespread use of torture, 
extrajudicial killing, barrel bombs, and chemical weapons. 

a. scope and dimensions of the non-state terrorist threat

in  recent  years,  terrorism-related  killings  have  been  overwhelmingly  concentrated  in  a 
handful of nations. in 2014 terrorists carried out 13,463 attacks which resulted in 32,727 
deaths, including of 6,200 perpetrators (start 2015, 3-6). sixty percent of the attacks 
took place in iraq, pakistan, afghanistan, india, and nigeria, and 78 percent of fatalities 
occurred in iraq, nigeria, afghanistan, pakistan, and syria (ibid.). isil or daesh (an 
arabic language acronym for isil) committed 17 percent of the attacks, followed by the 
taliban in afghanistan, al-shabaab in somalia, boko haram in nigeria, and maoists in 
india (ibid., 11).
nine of the 20 deadliest attacks occurred in nigeria (ibid., 9). indeed, in 2014, the number 
of  boko  haram  killings  exceeded  even  those  by  isil  (iep  2015,  22,  41),  to  whom  it 
declared allegiance in march 2015 (almukhtar 2015). boko haram began 2015 with the 
january 37 massacre of an estimated 2,000 residents of the town of baga in nigerias 
borno state and ended the year with an offensive in maiduguri, home to an estimated one 
million refugees and the capital of borno state, and in the town of madagali, southwest of 
maiduguri (sawab 2015).
between 2000 and 2014, the 3,659 terrorist killings in western states accounted for 2.6 
percent of the worlds total, with 91 percent of that number attributable to the september 
11, 2001 attacks, the madrid train bombings on march 11, 2004, the july 22, 2011 murders 
of 77 in norway, and the three london bombings on july 7, 2005 which killed 56 (iep 
2015, 50-51).38 

38   between 2006 and 2014, lone wolf attacks represented 70 percent of all terrorism-related killings in 
western states (iep 2015, 54-58).

95

refugee protection policies and national securityjihadist killings in the united states since 9/11 have invariably been committed by lone 
wolfs acting without guidance, direction, or assistance from terrorist groups (ibid., 69), a 
phenomenon known as leaderless jihad (bergen 2016, 52-53).39  forty-five persons were 
killed in the nine jihadist terrorist attacks in the united states between 2002 and 2015 (new 
america foundation 2015).40 fifty more persons were killed in the june 12, 2016 terrorist 
attack at a gay nightclub in orlando, florida.41 
the absence of large-scale coordinated attacks since 9/11 speaks, in part, to the degree 
of public support for the counterterror struggle (brooks 2011, 27).42 an analysis of us 
terrorist  plots  in  the  decade  after  9/11  concluded  that  those  most  likely  to  succeed 
involved accessible weapons (e.g., firearms) and small numbers of individuals that require 
minimal  skill  and  pre-operational  steps  (ibid.,  39).  intelligence  and  law  enforcement 
officials believe that attacks against soft targets, modeled on the november 2629, 2008 
attacks in mumbai by lashkar-e-taiba terrorists which killed 172 persons, have a greater 
probability of success than complex and ambitious 9/11-style attacks (riedel 2015). former 
new york city police department (nypd) commissioner raymond kelly characterized 
the november 13, 2015 paris attacks as shockingly simple to plan and implement (daly 
2015).  
the  statistics  on  jihadist  killings  in  the  united  states  help  to  contextualize  the  risk  of 
a catastrophic attack by a person admitted as a refugee, a very small category of well-
screened  and  vetted  residents. according  to  the  us  department  of  state  (dos),  only 
about a dozen of the nearly 785,000 refugees admitted since 9/11 have been arrested or 
removed from the u.s. due to terrorism concerns which preceded their admission (ye he 
lee 2015). there have been no domestic terrorist attacks by refugees during this period. 
however, these figures hardly offer cause for complacency. terrorists will continue to try to 
exploit all admission channels to targeted states (adamson 2006, 195; leiken and brooke 
2006,  510),  including  refugee  programs  (hattem  2016).    in  addition,  isil,  al-qaeda, 
and other groups are committed to inflicting catastrophic damage on their near and far 
enemies. military and intelligence officials have repeatedly warned of the risk of terrorist 
attacks against western states using improvised devices containing chemical, biological, 
radiological, or nuclear (cbrn) materials (rudischhauser 2015). in 2004, the national 
commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states (the 9/11 commission) warned 
that al-qaeda had been trying to secure weapons of mass destruction for at least a decade 
and viewed the united states as a prime target (9/11 commission, 381), which it remains 
today. 

b. the refugee/migrant and terrorism nexus 

the need for refugee-related security measures assumes a connection between refugees 
and a security threat. to develop effective security strategies and robust refugee protection 

39   these terrorists could also aptly be described as mass murderers.
40   these numbers reflect the success of us intelligence and law enforcement agencies in disrupting terrorist 
plots and preventing large-scale attacks since 9/11.
41   in that case, omar mateen, a us citizen of afghani descent, claimed allegiance to isil, but had no 
connection to the group and seemed to act from mixed motives (apuzzo and lichtblau 2016). 
42   the same conditions do not obtain in some european communities.

96

journal on migration and human securitysystems requires clarity on the relationship between the two. the nexus between terrorism 
and refugees can take a number of forms.  
first, state (political) terror, internal conflict, and international conflict are correlated with 
high  rates  of  terrorism  (iep  2015,  67-69;  schmid  2016,  17).43 an  analysis  of  terrorist 
attacks by non-state or sub-state actors resulting in at least one fatality between 1989 and 
2014 found that 92 percent occurred where levels of political terror were very high, 55 
percent in nations undergoing internal armed conflict, and 33 percent in nations embroiled 
in an internationalized conflict (iep 2015, 70-72). conversely, terrorist attacks occurred 
at very low rates (less than 1 percent) in states with no political terror or ongoing conflict 
(ibid., 72).44 
second, terrorist violence results in refugee flows and displacement. the 11 nations that 
experienced more than 500 terrorism-related deaths in 2014 produced the highest average 
numbers  of  refugees  and  idps  (iep  2015,  59-60).  similarly,  high  fatality  rates  from 
terrorism in syria, iraq, pakistan, and afghanistan strongly correspond to numbers of first-
time asylum seekers in europe (schmid 2016, 27). given their flight from nations with 
high levels of terrorist violence, it stands to reason that refugees would not typically opt 
to migrate to those same states. in fact, of the 10 largest refugee-hosting nations, only 
pakistan ranks among the top 10 countries affected by terrorist violence (iep 2015, 59-60). 
forced displacement has been a goal of lords resistance army, boko haram, and other 
terrorist groups (koser and cunningham 2015, 83).45 isil has killed, subjugated and driven 
religious minorities and others from its territory, while appealing to muslim refugees to 
return home, warning that they will be forced to convert in infidel lands (zelin 2015). 
in a modern version of draining the sea (civilians) to catch the fish (insurgents), the assad 
regime has targeted civilian populations and infrastructure, leading to massive displacement, 
in order to isolate and weaken rebel factions (schmid 2016, 20). 
while both state terror and non-state terrorism lead to refugee flows, it does not follow 
that refugees negatively impact security in host states. a recent analysis compared un 
data on the location of refugees, idps, asylum seekers and returnees, with subnational data 
on conflict onset from 1989 to 2008. the study concluded that refugee host communities 
tend to experience more stability over time, possibly due to the influx of humanitarian 
and security actors that often accompany refugees. it found no evidence that refugee 
communities increase the likelihood of conflict or facilitate regional conflict diffusion 
(shaver and zhou 2015, 2, 24). 
most resettled refugees do not fit terrorist profiles. former dhs secretaries napolitano 
and chertoff described syrian refugees as the most vulnerable  particularly survivors 
of violence and torture, those with severe medical conditions, and women and children.46 

43   the global terrorist index defines political terror as state sanctioned or state perpetrated violence against 
its citizens (iep 2015, 70).
44   in organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd) nations, terrorism is associated 
with social disenfranchisement, as reflected in youth unemployment, low confidence in democracy and the 
press, and other factors (iep 2015, 69).  
45   forced migration from has also been a strategic goal of the assad regime and of many past regimes, like 
the slobodan milosevics regime in serbia.

refugee protection policies and national securitythe united states has also prioritized the resettlement of iraqis and afghanis who worked 
at great peril with the us military and other us institutions.
third, although refugee settlement does not increase the overall probability of conflict in a 
region (shaver and zhou 2015, 2, 24), international migration can provide conduits for the 
diffusion of network-based forms of political violence and instability, which particularly 
threaten less stable and weaker states (adamson 2006, 191, 198).  
in el salvador, guatemala and honduras, for example, transnational criminal syndicates, 
fueled  in  part  by  us  deportation  policies  and  trafficked  firearms,  have  subverted  state 
institutions  (cidehum  and  unhcr  2012,  11,  13).  gangs  (maras)  subjugate  many 
communities in these states, extorting monies from businesses and individuals, conscripting 
youth, and effectively controlling access to public institutions like schools. gang violence 
and recruitment has, in turn, led to the migration of tens of thousands of unaccompanied 
children from mexico and central america, often to join parents who previously migrated 
to the united states (donato and sisk 2015, 73). as a measure of their desperation, us-
resident parents have chosen to hire smugglers, rather than expose their children to the 
risk  of  gang  violence  during  the  lengthy  application  processing  period  for  refugee  or 
humanitarian admission to the united states (hennessy-fiske 2016).
likewise, failed states and the effective absence of states in particular regions have paved 
the  way  for  terrorist  groups  to  establish  strongholds  in  somalia  (al-shabaab),  uganda 
(lords resistance army), and elsewhere. these groups, in turn, have displaced millions 
(schmid 2016, 22-23). 
fourth, counterterror and counter-insurgency initiatives, particularly in terrorist strongholds, 
can  also  cause  large-scale  displacement  (ibid.,  46-47).  following  9/11,  counterterror 
experts voiced concern over the ability of al-qaeda and the taliban to operate and plan 
attacks from ungoverned safe havens like the waziristan tribal region on the afghanistan 
and pakistan borders (rotberg 2002). a pakistani military offensive in this region in 2014 
led to the displacement of an estimated one million civilians (schmid 2016, 46).47 
fifth, nationals of western states have increasingly travelled abroad to receive training and 
to fight with terrorist groups. as of december 2015, an estimated 27,000 to 31,000 persons 
from 86 nations had traveled to syria and iraq to join isil and other extremist groups, 
including  more  than  5,000  from  europe  (primarily  from  france,  the  united  kingdom, 
germany, and belgium) and roughly 250 each from the united states and australia (soufan 
group, 4, 7-9, 12). some terrorists, particularly those who can no longer return home, 
move from one jihadist conflict to the next (schmid 2016, 43). 
jihadists have also returned to european and other western states in high numbers, posing 
a substantial threat of violence and accounting for a large percentage of terrorist plots in 
western states (ibid., 39, 42-43).48 an examination of 330 persons charged with a jihadist 

(nov.  19,  2015),  https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/11/19/two-former-homeland-security-secretaries-
wrote-president-obama-safely-welcoming. 
47   the iraq war displaced an estimated 2.7 million persons.
48   counterterror expert bruce hoffman argues that while the threat of homegrown violent extremism  is 
now accepted as fact, there is still surprisingly little consensus on the potentially far greater danger posed by 
radicalized foreign fighters trained by isis, returning to their native or adopted homelands in the west  
(hoffman 2015).

98

journal on migration and human securityterrorist-related  offence  in  the  united  states  since  9/11  found  that  nearly  one-half  had 
traveled overseas to join a jihadist group or had attempted to do so (bergen 2016, 168-69).49  
sixth, the migration-related security threat most commonly articulated in media and policy 
circles involves the potential entry of foreign terrorist operatives into states, whether for 
reconnaissance, as sleepers for future mobilization, or as muscle for imminent attacks. 
some threats originate in western states. us citizen david headley, for example, made 
seven reconnaissance trips in preparation for lashkar-e-taibas november 2629, 2008 
attacks in mumbai (bergen 2016, 193). 
international migrants hardly constitute the only source of the terrorist threat. a study of 
373 charged, convicted, and/or killed jihadi terrorists from transnational sunni islamist 
terrorist  groups  operating  in  western  europe  and  north america  from  1993  through 
december 14, 2004 concluded that 41 percent were nationals of eu or north american 
states (leiken and brooke 2016, 507-08). however it also found some degree of overlap 
between immigration and terrorist networks, particularly of north african immigrants in 
the european union and canada (ibid., 509, 513). 
terrorists will continue to probe the security of migration channels and try to enter targeted 
states in whatever ways might be available to them, as evidenced by the entry of tashfeen 
malik, one of the two san bernardino killers, on an f-1 (fiance) visa. perhaps the most 
troubling breaches of the us refugee program have involved iraqi nationals arrested prior to 
planned attacks.50 the first case involved waad alwan and mohanad hammadi, who were 
admitted as refugees in 2009 (doj 2013), despite having participated in the insurgency 
against us troops in iraq and afghanistan. after settling in bowling green, kentucky, 
they became the subject of an fbi sting operation (based on a tip) and sought to purchase 
weapons for al qaeda in iraq (aqi), a predecessor to isil. 
the federal bureau of investigation (fbi) subsequently found alwans finger and palm 
prints on the base of a cordless phone which had been connected to unexploded ieds in 
iraq.51 as a result of this case, the federal government halted iraqi refugee admissions for 
several months, intensified screening of iraqis (meek and ross 2015; madhani 2012), and 
eliminated delays in processing weapons for biometric and other evidence. 

49  beyond  isil,  the  al  qaeda  affiliated  group  jabhat  al-nusrah  or  the  al-nusra  front  (in  northwestern 
syria), the core al qaeda group (the khorasan group) in syria, and al qaeda in the arabian peninsula, 
present a high threat of terrorism in europe, the united states and against us and western interests and 
institutions.  the  syrian  refugee  crisis  and  us  national  security:  hearing  before  the  house  judiciary 
ommittee, subcommittee on immigration and border security, 114th cong. (2015) (testimony of seth g. 
jones, rand office of external affairs), http://judiciary.house.gov/_cache/files/7d555810-97fb-4632-bb44-
a44579ff2f32/11.19.15-seth-jones-testimony.pdf.
50   for this reason, some view these arrests as a counterterror and law enforcement success, an example of 
the system working.  
51   the phone was stored in an fbi repository for ordnance from conflict zones in iraq, afghanistan, and 
elsewhere. alwan pled guilty to conspiring to kill and to the use of a weapon of mass destruction (explosives) 
against  us  nationals  abroad;  distributing  information  on  the  manufacture  and  use  of  ieds;  attempting 
to provide material support to terrorists and aqi; and conspiring to transfer, possess and export stinger 
missiles. hammadi pled guilty to attempting to provide material support to terrorists and aqi; conspiring 
to transfer, possess and export stinger missiles; and making a false statement in an immigration application 
(doj 2013).

refugee protection policies and national securityin january 2016, the us department of justice (doj) announced the arrests of two more 
iraqi nationals, aws mohammed younis al-jayab and omar faraj saeed al hardan, who 
entered as refugees. al-jayab allegedly left the united states to fight in syria with terrorist 
groups between november 2013 and january 2014. unlike al-jayab, al hardan apparently 
became radicalized after his arrival. he allegedly conspired with al jayab to fight for isil 
and to commit terrorist acts in the united states (lozano 2016).
seventh, terrorist groups have sought to recruit and radicalize vulnerable, often long-term 
refugees (koser and cunnigham 2015, 83-84; schmid 2016, 32-37). some scholars have 
argued  that  refugee  camps  serve  as  breeding  grounds  for  terrorism  and  a  source  of 
insecurity for host states and entire regions (loesher and milner 2014, 7). syrian refugees 
reportedly face isil recruitment in lebanese, jordanian, and turkish camps (schmid 2016, 
33-35; speckhard 2015). beyond the threat of terrorist violence (naylor 2016), refugees 
have suffered xenophobic attacks in host communities (schmid 2016, 40).
eighth, politicians and the media treat radicalization, which can be highly sophisticated 
and incessant,52 as a migration-related phenomenon. however, terrorist recruitment often 
occurs after the migration process takes place and does not involve immigrants. of the 71 
persons charged by the united states with isil-related activities between march 2014 and 
december 2015, 58 percent were us citizens and six were us lawful permanent residents 
(lprs) (vidino and hughes 2015, ix, 7). 
yet  isil,  al-shabaab,  jabhat  al-nustra  and  other  terrorist  groups  have  also  had  some 
success in targeting persons from select refugee communities for recruitment (jordan and 
kesling 2015). a group of nine somali-americans from the minneapolis/st. paul area, 
for example, have been convicted of terrorism-related offenses related to a plot to join 
isil in syria and a 10th member of the group is thought to have fled to syria (mcdowell 
2016). according to the fbi, since 2007, 22 men have left minnesota to join al-shabab and 
roughly 12 minnesotans (men and women) have joined militant groups in syria (ibid.). 
another person of somali descent, a naturalized us citizen living in columbus, ohio, 
allegedly received terrorist training in syria and, upon his return, intended to carry out 
attacks in the united states (doj 2015a).
persons of other nationalities have also supported terrorist groups. for example, abdullah 
ramo pazara, a bosnian native from st. louis, left the united states to join isil in may 
2013. six other bosnians, including refugee mediha salkicevic, allegedly sent equipment 
and funds to pazara who was killed in fall of 2014, to isil and to other terrorist groups 
(patrick 2015). in addition, fazliddin kurbanov, an uzbek refugee living in boise, idaho, 
was convicted in august 2015 of conspiracy and attempting to provide material support to 
the islamic movement of uzbekistan, and possession of an unregistered destructive device 
(doj 2015b).

52   isil, for example, seeks to create an echo chamber and virtual community in order to indoctrinate recruits 
and convince them to join isil fighters abroad or to commit attacks in the united states (vidino and hughes 
2015, ix, 5, 21-26). many thousand americans access isils online propaganda each day.

journal on migration and human securityv.  migration-related  security  imperatives  and  pitfalls: 
the us experience in the post-9/11 era
september 11, 2016 represents the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks when 19 al-qaeda 
terrorists hijacked four airplanes, killing 2,977 persons and injuring many thousand more 
at the world trade center (2,753 killed, including 11 pregnant women), pentagon (184 
killed), and united flight 93 (40 killed). among the victims were persons from 93 nations, 
71 new york city and port authority police officers, and 343 firefighters. 
the attacks led to a period of national soul searching over how to safeguard the nation 
from extremist violence while preserving its diverse, rights-respecting and open character. 
the  us  immigration  system  has  invariably  been  implicated  in  this  debate  because  of 
immigrations defining significance in us history and because the 9/11 terrorists exploited 
legal immigration channels to enter and remain. several counterterror strategies have been 
pursued  during  this  era.  some  have  proven  successful  and  others  misguided  and  even 
counter-productive.

a. risk management

risk management has emerged as an integrating, organizational principle in the post-9/11 
era (dhs 2014, 32; dhs 2011a). this concept speaks to the need to allocate (necessarily) 
limited resources in proportion to the likelihood of a threat coming to pass and its potential 
severity.53 it weighs the benefit of a security measure against its financial and other costs 
(kerwin and stock 2007, 394). under this principle, a state accepts certain risks, reduces 
others,  and  concentrates  on  the  most  consequential  (dhs  2010,  55).  in  its  strategic 
national  risk assessment,  dhs  identifies  natural  disasters,  technological  hazards,  and 
terrorist attacks as among the greatest threats to the us homeland, but does not include 
immigration and border violations which it characterizes as chronic society concerns 
(dhs 2011b). 
the  united  states  issued  nearly  10  million  non-immigrant  (temporary)  visas  in  2014 
(dos 2015b). although these numbers dwarf refugee admissions, non-immigrant tourists, 
business people, and students have not been subject to nearly the same level of scrutiny and 
suspicion as refugees have, which raises the question: why not? 
like  the  refugee  program,  many  non-immigrant  programs  have  an  underlying  non-
economic  rationale.54  however,  they  also  bring  immediate  economic  benefits,  which  a 
lengthy and burdensome screening process would threaten. visitors to the united states, 
for example, spent $220.8 billion and created an estimated 7.9 million jobs in 2014 (ita 
2014). the nearly one million international students in us colleges and universities in 
2014/15 contributed $30.8 billion to the us economy (iie 2015). the us immigration 
system delivers an inordinate share of the worlds best talent, providing a windfall in a 
global economy where heavy advantages accrue to the most innovative companies and the 
countries where they are based (cfr 2009, 14). 

53   as the 9/11 commission put it, america can be attacked in many ways and has many vulnerabilities. 
no defenses are perfect. but risks must be calculated; hard choices must be made about allocating resources 
(9/11 commission 2004, 364).
54   for example, foreign students are exposed to the united states culturally diverse, democratic society, 
often winning their life-long support and admiration (cfr 2009, 8). 

101

refugee protection policies and national securitydhs has been criticized for its inability to bring risk-analysis capabilities and cost-benefit 
analysis to its decision making and program evaluation (steward, ellingwood, and mueller 
2011,  369,  383).  yet  the  concept  itself  is  widely  embraced  by  us  law  enforcement, 
intelligence, and homeland security agencies,55 albeit not by politicians who do not want to 
concede the possibility of terrorist attacks or the need for security trade-offs. 
terrorists will seek to enter targeted states through whatever migration routes might be 
open to them. even the most exhaustive screening processes must be continuously adjusted 
based on evolving intelligence, field experience, and newly discovered vulnerabilities.56 
because  risk  cannot  be  eliminated,  to  demand  absolute  security  for  refugee  protection 
programs represents a transparent way to oppose and politicize protection.
the  question  of  whether  radicalized  european  nationals  might  enter  the  united  states 
through the visa waiver program (vwp) has been intensely debated since the november 
2015 paris attacks.57 terrorists exploited the vwp program both before and after the 9/11 
attacks, and counterterror experts and commentators (including the author) identified the 
program as a source of vulnerability (kerwin and stock 2007, 402-04; ginsburg 2010, 283-
86). since that time, the security of the vwp program has been significantly strengthened. 
the vwp allows nationals from 38 states to enter the united states for business or pleasure 
for up to 90 days without a visa. commentators point out that the program is more secure 
than us non-immigrant (temporary) and immigrant visa programs because participating 
states  must  agree  to  share  terrorism-related  intelligence  and  use  machine-readable  e 
passports  which  contain  biographic  data  and  biometric  identifiers  in  an  electronic  chip 
(alden 2015). at this writing, the united states has entered preventing and combating 
serious crime (pcsc) agreements with 35 vwp nations and with other nations that seek 
admission  to  the  program  (dhs  2015a). these  agreements  provide  for  access  to  other 
countries biographic and biometric data about potential terrorists and serious criminals. 
the eu, however, does not share biometric data (fingerprints) with the united states from 
its eurodac system, which is used to detect multiple asylum applications from the same 
person and to screen for unauthorized entry. 
the united states requires visitors from vwp states to register, prior to travel, through its 
electronic system for travel authorization (esta) program, which collects biographic, 
criminal and other information. it screens esta information against multiple databases 
and watch lists. participating states must also share information on lost or stolen passports 
and agree to airport security requirements.
in 2015 and 2016, dhs and congress sought to strengthen the vwps security and promote 

55   the alternative to risk-management is to devote insufficient resources to substantial risks or excessive 
resources to less severe and likely threats. 
56   in march 2016, dhs secretary jeh johnson expressed concern over the potential for terrorists to enter 
through the us refugee program (hattem 2016).
57    the  march  18,  2016  agreement  between  turkey  and  the  european  union  has  intensified  concerns 
related to the infiltration of criminals and terrorists into the european union from turkey, serbia, and other 
candidates for visa liberalization (coates 2016). under this agreement, turkey has agreed to readmit from 
greece new irregular migrants in return for visa-free travel of turkish nationals to the european union, 
increased resettlement in europe of syrian refugees residing in turkey, and greater eu financial support to 
turkey.

journal on migration and human securityfull compliance with its requirements. on august 6, 2015, dhs announced that all vwp 
travelers would need e-passports, participating states would be required to use interpol 
lost and stolen passport database to screen travelers crossing their borders, and the use 
of us federal air marshals on international flights from vwp nations would be expanded 
(dhs  2015b).  on  november  30,  2015,  dhs  announced  that  the  esta  process  would 
collect information on travel to nations that constitute a terrorist safe haven (white house 
2015a).
the  omnibus  appropriations  bill  for  2016  incorporated  h.r.  158,  the  visa  waiver 
improvement and terrorist travel prevention action of 2015.58 this legislation:

 

  bars persons from iraq, syria, iran, sudan and any other country or area of concern 

on or after march 1, 2011 from participating in the program; 
sets deadlines for vwp nations to issue and use machine-readable, fraud-resistant 
passports  with  biometric  information;  to  screen  and  validate  such  passports  at 
ports-of-entry (poes); and to screen non-citizens against interpol databases on 
arrival and departure for unlawful activity; and 

  provides for the termination of nations in the vwp for failure to share information 

or to screen properly.  

dhs subsequently announced that it would add libya, somalia, and yemen as countries 
of concern (dhs 2016b).

b.  intelligence  collection,  information  sharing,  and  identity 

assurance
the 9/11 attacks constituted a failure of intelligence gathering and information sharing. 
fifteen of the 19 hijackers were vulnerable to interception (9/11 commission 2004, 752-
53). three had been identified by the intelligence community as potential terrorists and 
the central intelligence agency (cia) knew that two of the three had entered the united 
states. however, the cia failed to provide this information to the fbi in a timely way and 
the terrorists names were only belatedly added to the doss list of known or suspected 
terrorists (ibid., 181-82). in addition, neither the cia or fbi shared information on terrorist 
travel  and  passport  practices  with  immigration,  consular,  or  customs  officials  (kerwin 
2005, 752), or systematically captured and analyzed the substantial knowledge of these 
agencies on terrorist travel methods (ginsburg 2010, 130-31).59 
in addition, states and localities had long resented the paucity of information sharing by 
federal  law  enforcement  agencies. the  nypd  repeatedly  voiced  these  concerns  in  the 
aftermath of the first world trade center bombing on february 26, 1993, which killed 
six and injured more than 1,000 persons, including 88 firefighters, 35 police officers, and 
an emergency medical services worker (kelly 2015, 90-91, 95-96). following the 9/11 
attacks, the nypd built its own immense intelligence and counterterrorism apparatus to 
complement the work of federal agencies (ibid., 165-78).

58   consolidated appropriations act, 2016, pub. l. no. 114-113,  203 and 204 (2015).
59   refugees can also be a source of information on the conditions in terrorist-producing countries and (on 
occasion) regarding potential terrorists in their communities (kerwin and stock 2007, 400-01).  

103

refugee protection policies and national securityafter  9/11,  the  united  states  prioritized  intelligence  collection,  combined  pre-9-11 
terrorist watch-lists into a single, federal terrorist screening data base (tsdb), made 
this information available to federal, state and local officials, and established a feed-back 
loop to the fbi on all encounters with known or suspected terrorists.60 it also prioritized 
the need for secure identification documents and, in particular, biometrically-enhanced, 
machine-readable passports for those seeking admission to the united states (ginsburg 
2010, 194-97).  

aggravating the threat, isil has secured hundreds of thousands 

of false, stolen and blank syrian and  iraqi passports, and 

german officials have been able to obtain fingerprints on only 

a small percentage of arriving refugees and migrants

by contrast, information sharing in europe on suspected terrorists and criminals remains 
far from systematic (de la baume and paravicini 2015; mazzetti 2016). european states 
lack a comprehensive list of suspected extremists and do not consistently check arriving 
migrants against interpol databases of stolen passports and terrorist alerts (fidler and 
pop 2015). before the november 13, 2015 paris attacks, only 20 percent of the migrants 
entering greece from turkey received full security screening and processing (faiola and 
mekhennet 2016). moreover, a low percentage of arriving refugees in germany (25 to 30 
percent) possessed passports or travel documents. aggravating the threat, isil has secured 
hundreds of thousands of false, stolen and blank syrian and iraqi passports, and german 
officials  have  been  able  to  obtain  fingerprints  on  only  a  small  percentage  of  arriving 
refugees and migrants (schmid 2016, 8-9). the november 13, 2015 paris attacks have been 
attributed to [p]oor information-sharing among intelligence agencies, a threadbare system 
for tracking suspects across open borders, and an unmanageably long list of homegrown 
extremists (witte and morris 2015). 
most  migrants  to  europe  have  fled  violence  and  war,  extreme  poverty,  and  untenable 
conditions. however, this massive population has included persons with bad motives. an 
estimated three dozen terrorists who entered europe posing as migrants have been arrested 
while  planning  attacks  or  have  died  during  attacks  (faiola  and  mekhennet  2016). the 
inability of eu and state officials to establish the identity and effectively screen refugees 
and migrants presents an immense source of vulnerability. germany has endured several 
attacks by asylum seekers, as it works through its processing backlogs and slowly gains 
intelligence on recently arrived asylum seekers and migrants (faiola and kirchner 2016). 
two of the terrorists responsible for the coordinated attacks in paris on november 13, 2015 
entered as migrants through greece, claiming to be asylum seekers, and they subsequently 
registered at a refugee camp in serbia (faiola and mekhennet 2016). others who entered 
in refugee and migrant streams have also been implicated in terrorist plots (troianovski 
and turner 2016).

104

journal on migration and human securityalthough  federal  law  enforcement  agencies  characterized  irregular  immigrants  as  a 
threat to national security in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, a consensus subsequently 
developed  among  intelligence  and  law  enforcement  professionals  that  terrorist  groups 
preferred  recruits  without  criminal  records  or  immigration  problems,  so-called  clean 
skins who were not likely to draw the attention of the police or security services (kerwin 
and stock 2007, 406-07).61 however, many jihadists and terrorist sympathizers operate 
relatively  openly  in  european  and  other  nations.  the  perpetrators  of  the  january  and 
november 2015 paris attacks and the march 2016 brussels attacks included extremists 
whose jihadist sympathies, ties, and even past conspiracies were well-known to european 
law enforcement and security services. the size of the threat posed by their own nationals 
has overwhelmed the surveillance and law enforcement capacity of several european states: 
an estimated 38,000 foreign fighters have travelled to syria and iraq since 2012, including 
5,000 europeans and 1,700 from france (ignatius 2016; erlanger and yardley 2015).
the 9/11 attacks also underscored the importance of establishing the identity of persons 
seeking admission, leading to a renewed focus on the integrity of the breeder documents 
(particularly  birth  certificates)  used  to  obtain  other  identity  documents,  the  need  for 
biometrically-enhanced  passports  and  other  travel  documents,  and  the  importance  of 
information  sharing  on  lost  and  stolen  passports  (ginsburg  2010,  191-216).  returning 
jihadists and foreign terrorists have used falsified passports and identity documents to enter 
western states (schmid 2016, 43-44).  

c.  national  unity  and  enlisting  community  and  international 

support
law  enforcement  and  intelligence  experts  post-9/11  stressed  the  need  for  resilience  in 
response to the terrorist threat; that is, to combat terrorism in ways that do not compromise 
national  unity  or  civic  values  (flynn  2004,  163-64).  rights-respecting  enforcement  is 
also a strong theme of dhss planning process and communications (dhs 2014, 32). by 
contrast, demagoguery and divisive counterterror strategies can compromise national unity 
and alienate groups that may have information on potential threats and have the most to lose 
from an attack by a perceived member of their national, ethnic, or religious community.  
the vilification of muslims represents one of the greatest threats to national unity and a 
boon to terrorists, who seek to polarize populations (schmid 2016, 46). david petraeus, the 
former cia director and commander of coalition forces in iraq and afghanistan, warns that 
anti-muslim rhetoric is playing directly into the hands of al qaeda and isil, which hope 
to provoke a clash of civilizations (petraeus 2016). to that end, al-shabaab has featured 
the proposal to suspend muslim immigration to the united states in one of its recruitment 
videos (stack 2016).
following the 9/11 attacks, president george w. bush, new york city mayor rudolph 
giuliani, immigration and naturalization service (ins) commissioner james ziglar, dhs 
secretary  tom  ridge  and  other  leaders  took  pains  to  distinguish  between  law-abiding 
immigrants and refugees. in the immediate aftermath of the attacks, president bush visited 
61   as of yet, there is no documented case of a terrorist arriving in the united states through illegal migration 
channels, although many have entered fraudulently through legal immigration system.

105

refugee protection policies and national securitythe islamic center in washington, dc, where he made a powerful appeal to national unity 
and tolerance:

the  face  of  terror  is  not  the  true  faith  of  islam.  thats  not  what  islam  is  all 
about. islam is peace. these terrorists dont represent peace. they represent evil 
and war.
when we think of islam we think of a faith that brings comfort to a billion people 
around the world. billions of people find comfort and solace and peace. and thats 
made brothers and sisters out of every race  out of every race.
america  counts  millions  of  muslims  amongst  our  citizens,  and  muslims  make 
an incredibly valuable contribution to our country. muslims are doctors, lawyers, 
law professors, members of the military, entrepreneurs, shopkeepers, moms and 
dads. and they need to be treated with respect. in our anger and emotion, our fellow 
americans must treat each other with respect. 

(white house 2001). 

the 9/11 commission report also made this point starkly: 

islam is not the enemy. it is not synonymous with terror. nor does islam teach 
terror. america and its friends oppose a perversion of islam, not the great world 
faith itself. 

(9/11 commission 2004, 363)
in  stark  contrast,  donald  trump,  the  republican  presidential  nominee,  has  flaunted 
international and domestic law by proposing that the united states suspend the admission 
of non-us citizen muslims, deny entry to syrian refugees, kill the families of terrorists, 
renew waterboarding of terrorist suspects, and track refugees in the united states (bradner 
2015). this anti-muslim invective follows a 15-year period in which not a single attack 
was committed in the united states by a terrorist posing as a refugee, and every jihadist 
attack has been roundly condemned by muslim leaders and groups. 
some  politicians  have  proposed  patrolling  muslim  neighborhoods  and  admitting  only 
or mostly christian refugees (davidson 2015). christians and other religious minorities 
endure forced conversion, extortion, religious cleansing (what some have characterized 
as genocide), and extraordinary levels of persecution in large swaths of the middle-east,62 
where they have lived for centuries. yet scores of muslims, the great majority of the regions 
refugees, likewise have no viable option to resettlement. although difficult to estimate, 
muslims certainly constitute a large percentage of the victims of terrorist violence if only 
because terrorism-related fatalities in recent years have mostly occurred in nations with 
high muslim populations (schmid 2016, 12; alexander and moore 2015).
the december 1, 2015 letter from former, high-level us diplomatic, intelligence, military, 
and homeland security officials opposed a de facto moratorium on admissions of refugees 

62   throughout its history, the united states has offered protection to victims of religious intolerance and 
persecution. in addition, it has regularly renewed legislation that creates a presumption of refugee status for 
religious minorities and other historically persecuted groups (nezer 2014, 128). in addition, resettlement 
priority cases of special humanitarian concern include members of persecuted religious groups. 

106

journal on migration and human securityfrom syria and iraq on the grounds that it would be contrary to our nations traditions 
of  openness  and  inclusivity,  and  would  undermine  our  core  objective  of  combatting 
terrorism.63 they argued that refugee resettlement helps to advance us national security 
interests by supporting the stability of our allies and partners that are struggling to host 
large number of refugees.64 
they also averred that [c]ategorically refusing to admit muslims feeds the narrative of 
isil that there is a war between islam and the west, that muslims are not welcome in the 
united states and europe, and that the isil caliphate is their true home.65 this latter point 
merits particular attention. isil views the flight of refugees from territories that it controls 
as a challenge to the legitimacy of its caliphate.66 as a result, it has appealed to syrian 
refugees to return, arguing that they will be forced to convert in the lands of infidels and 
will be welcomed home in its territory (zelin 2015).
michael hayden, the former director of the cia and the national security agency (nsa), 
argues  that  anti-muslim  rhetoric  and  discriminatory  proposals  play  into  the  extremist 
narrative that muslims are born into a world of unrelenting hostility towards islam from 
the  judeo-christian  west  (cfr  2015).  hayden  called  it  doubly  stupid  when  we  say 
things that reinforce that incredibly false narrative (ibid.).
former dhs secretary chertoff argues that a religious litmus test would be odious to the 
values of america and utterly impractical to enforce in the real world.67 dhs secretary 
jeh johnson said that this approach would burn bridges to american muslims when were 
trying to go in the exact opposite direction (kim 2015).
james ziglar argues that a moratorium on muslim immigration would not achieve any

refugee protection policies and national securitymuslims, lead to increases in hate crimes, undermine the security and integration of muslim 
immigrants, and embolden us extremist groups. jihadist terrorists seek to drive a wedge 
between refugees and their host states. as one commentator put it, equating refugees with 
terrorists is simple: its exactly what the islamic state wants (taylor 2015).

d. failed and misguided strategies 

if  intelligence  collection,  information  sharing,  identity  assurance,  and  national  unity 
emerged from the post-9/11 era as hallmarks of an effective and coordinated counterterror 
strategy, this era also produced several excesses and anomalies. many post-9/11 refugee- 
and migration-related security strategies have since been discredited as counterterror tools. 
in the weeks following 9/11, us law enforcement and immigration agencies desperately 
sought to disrupt and prevent what they believed to be imminent, additional attacks. the 
national  security  entry-exit  registration  system  (nseers)  registered  (temporary) 
non-immigrants from certain countries upon their entry and required that they re-register 
after 30 days and annually thereafter. it also included a call-in, domestic registration 
program for those in the united states at the programs inception. the latter program led 
to the registration of 83,519 non-immigrants from 25 nations and the arrest of roughly 
13,000 persons of middle eastern and south asian descent for immigration violations, but 
it yielded little useful intelligence (martin 2009, 25-26; kerwin 2005, 760-61). an analysis 
of this program concluded that the order in which national groups were required to register 
did not align with the stated criteria (an al-qaeda presence) for inclusion of states in the 
program (leiken and brooke 2006, 515). nor was it rational from a security perspective to 
limit the program to non-immigrants (ibid.). 
in  the  immediate  aftermath  of  the  9/11  attacks,  the  united  states  also  arrested  and 
detained in often abusive conditions hundreds of non-citizen men who purportedly had 
some connection (however attenuated) to the 9/11 terrorists (kerwin 2002, 23-26). many 
detainees were held incommunicado and could not be located by family members or counsel 
for protracted periods.  federal officials held the detainees for immigration violations or 
as  material  witnesses  for  criminal  proceedings,  while  pressuring  them  for  information 
on terrorist plots which they mostly did not possess. a significant number were subject 
to closed court hearings. however, the initiative led to only one arrest of an al-qaeda-
affiliated terrorist (bergen 2016, 32).69 
in 2008, adopting a similar broad net strategy, the fbis controlled application review 
and resolution program (carrp) began to pressure mostly muslim, known or suspected 
or  non-known  or  suspected  terrorists  to  become  government  informants  by  delaying 
consideration  of  their  applications  for  immigration  status,  naturalization,  or  protection 
(ansari and datoo 2016). critics contend that this program withholds immigration benefits 
from persons who present no threat and produces little, if any, actionable intelligence (ibid.). 
the  fbi  has  also  been  criticized  for  using  its  large  network  of  informants  to  propose 
terrorist operations to often impressionable and hapless persons, and to help execute plots 

69   in addition, these practices can potentially alienate populations in which terrorists might try to hide and 
could diminish cooperation with intelligence and law enforcement agencies (kerwin et al. 2003).

108

journal on migration and human securitythat would not otherwise be pursued (bergen 2016, 97-98). the strategy has been defended 
on the grounds that it increases suspicion among terrorists and makes it difficult to organize, 
large-scale attacks (ibid., 100). however, it can also lead to long-term prison sentences for 
persons who would never have conceived of or carried out plots on their own. 
a common denominator of these tactics has been their reliance on broad profiling and 
preventive or pre-textual use of immigration enforcement tools. as many counterterror 
experts cautioned after 9/11, strategies that target persons based on race, religion, ethnicity, 
or national origin cast far too wide and indiscriminate a net to be useful law enforcement 
tools  (kerwin  2005,  755).  in  addition,  discriminatory  policies  cannot  attract  the  kind 
of broad, sustained support necessary to address what will likely be a long-term threat 
(heymann 2003, 88-92, 162). 
on the other hand, profiling based on terrorist behavior, tactics, and real-time intelligence 
constitutes  a  crucial  counterterror  and  law  enforcement  tool. an  analysis  of  475  isil 
recruits  from western  states  found  that  one  in  seven  were  women  (bergen  2016,  267-
68), a substantial increase that demonstrates how terrorists adapt to established profiles. in 
recent years, the fbi has sought to identify serious threats through universal indicators 
of  violence.  the  typical  progression  to  a  terrorist  attack,  for  example,  moves  from  a 
grievance, to a sense of the necessity of violence, to concrete planning, and to leakage 
of information about an imminent attack (ibid., 233-38). law enforcement intervention 
would be indicated at the latter stages of this process.
the  post-9/11  era  also  witnessed  several  dubious  and  exaggerated  security  claims  for 
measures as diverse as the interdiction and detention of haitian boat people, the indefinite 
detention of immigrants who had been ordered removed, and the us-canada safe-third 
country asylum agreement which requires that asylum claims, with some exceptions, be 
lodged in the first of the two states that an asylum-seeker enters.

e. border security

in the post-9/11 era, borders have become a potent political symbol of migration-related 
security concerns. borders also represent a potential point of vulnerability and exposure 
for terrorists. the ease with which the perpetrators of the november 13, 2015 paris and the 
march 22, 2016 brussels attacks moved within eu states and returned to the eu following 
jihadist activity abroad underscores the potential security function of borders and ports-
of-entry (mazzetti 2016).70 porous borders have also been blamed for al-shabab attacks in 
kenya, boko harams infiltration of niger, chad and cameroon, and isil attacks in libya, 
tunisia, and egypt (sieff 2016).
the massive growth in border infrastructure since 9/11 in the united states may deter 
some terrorists from seeking to enter. however, the greater security need is to identify 
and foil committed terrorists, preferably before they reach national boundaries, to promote 
orderly,  regulated  migration  flows  so  that  states  can  concentrate  their  resources  on  the 
small number of border crossers that may present a public safety or security risk, and to 
combat the radicalization of residents.

and returned to the european union without being detected.

109

refugee protection policies and national securitymoreover, the us investment in hardening the southern border does not correspond to 
the  size  of  the  security  threat  posed  by  the  border. an  analysis  of  373  jihadi  terrorists 
between 1993 and 2004 found that not a single terrorist crossed the us-mexico border 
where 87 percent of border patrol agents are stationed (us border patrol 2015), but it 
identified 26 confirmed terrorists in canada, three of whom had entered or tried to enter the 
united states (leiken and brooke 2006, 513). dhss main metrics for border security  
apprehensions, repeat crossings (recidivism) and effectiveness in arresting or turning 
back  unauthorized  migrants  (crs  2016,  22-23)    speak  almost  entirely  to  irregular 
migration, not to terrorism. in addition, most newly unauthorized us residents enter the 
nation legally and violate the terms of their temporary visas, rather than cross in irregular 
migration streams (warren and kerwin 2015, 93-94). thus, even if unauthorized persons 
posed a heightened security risk (which they do not), greater investment in border control 
would not significantly mitigate that risk.
border enforcement growth has also led to diminished refugee protection. over the last 20 
years, security and enforcement agencies have been vested with broad refugee protection 
responsibilities. under us law, migrants without sufficient travel documents or who are 
stopped at a port-of-entry or apprehended at or near a border face expedited removal unless 
they request political asylum or express a fear of return to a border official. if they do, 
they must be referred for a credible fear interview by a member of usciss specially 
trained asylum corps. if determined to possess a credible fear of persecution, they can seek 
political asylum. 
us customs and border protection (cbp) and, in particular, the us border patrol, draw 
heavily from us military veterans and enjoy a strong paramilitary and law enforcement 
culture. yet these officials also bear responsibility for deciding whether to refer migrants 
for credible fear determinations (which can lead to political asylum hearings) or to remove 
them without judicial recourse. border officials often seek to dissuade asylum seekers from 
pursuing their claims by threatening them with detention and separation from their families 
(cabot 2014, 366-67). the us commission on international religious freedom has twice 
investigated the us expedited removal process and found that border officials often fail to 
ask migrants if they fear returning home and fail to note when migrants express fear, which 
can lead to their detention and summary removal (uscirf 2005, 20-23; uscirf 2016, 
21-23). cbps screening of unaccompanied children to determine if they fear return or 
have been trafficked has been similarly problematic (gaob 2015). in addition, dozens of 
complaints have been filed regarding the poor and abusive treatment of children in border 
patrol holding cells (burnett 2014).
in  2015,  dhss  office  of  inspector  general  (oig)  reported  that  certain  border  patrol 
sectors refer asylum seekers for criminal prosecution (oig 2015, 16) in violation of the 
refugee convention. criminal prosecution makes it far more difficult to sustain an asylum 
claim, punishes bona fide asylum seekers for reaching protection in the only way available 
to many of them, and causes asylees to begin life in their new communities with a criminal 
record  (kerwin  2015,  218-19).  in  response  to  this  practice,  oig  accepted  the  border 
patrols claim that criminal prosecutions for illegal entry and the asylum process should 
proceed on parallel tracks (oig 2015, 17-18)  which manifestly they should not  while 
recommending only that the border patrol develop guidance on this issue.

journal on migration and human securityvi. the us refugee resettlement program: a case study 
in securing refugee flows
the current era of record displacement demands us leadership. yet not since usraps 
creation  in  1980  has  there  been  greater  opposition  in  the  united  states  to  refugee 
resettlement. this  section  examines  security-related  concerns  regarding  the  program  in 
light of its strong vetting and screening process. 

a. recent opposition to us refugee resettlement

in  late  2015,  the  us  house  of  representatives  passed  the american  security against 
foreign enemies act of 2015 (the safe act), which would have precluded the admission 
of refugees from iraq or syria, or refugees who last lived in or recently visited these two 
nations, until the director of the fbi, the secretary of dhs, and the director of national 
intelligence (dni) certified to 12 congressional committees that the refugee did not represent 
a threat. in addition, the act would have required the dhs inspector general to review and 
report annually to the same committees on each certification. requiring high-level sign-off 
on individual admissions from these nations would have brought resettlement to a standstill 
for some of the worlds most desperate refugees and would have risked diverting limited 
homeland security and law enforcement resources from more pressing needs.71 president 
obama vowed to veto this legislation (eop 2015), and in january 2016 the bill failed to 
win sufficient support to proceed to passage in the senate.
in recent years, many states and localities have voiced concerns that refugees pose a terrorist 
threat, strain local resources, and cannot be absorbed into their communities (brown and 
scribner 2014, 109-10). in 2015, 31 us governors vowed to prevent syrian refugees from 
resettling in their states (fantz and brumfield 2015), despite the well-established authority 
of  the  federal  government  to  set  immigration  and  refugee  policies.  the  state  of  texas 
brought an ultimately unsuccessful lawsuit to enjoin the resettlement of syrian refugees, 
based on the claim that the federal government and federally funded resettlement agencies 
had failed in their statutory responsibility to consult with the state prior to placement of 
refugees (walters and ura 2016).
state hostility toward resettlement of syrian and iraqi refugees may be less a legal than a 
practical threat to the refugee program, which depends heavily on partnerships between 
participating  federal  agencies,  non-governmental  resettlement  agencies,  and  states  and 
localities. the refugee act of 1980 provides for advance consultation with states and local 
governments and consideration of their placement concerns, suitability, and capacity. as a 
result, resettlement agencies meet on a regular basis with state and local officials regarding 
the services available to refugees in their communities and their ability to accommodate 
new arrivals. state resettlement offices receive federal funding to provide cash assistance, 
medical  assistance,  language  programs,  and  social  services.  in  the  past,  dos  has 
occasionally urged the modification of refugee placement plans based on feedback from 
states. in addition, under federal law, if states do not want to distribute benefits to refugees,

refugee protection policies and national securitythe office of refugee resettlement can enter into arrangements with ngos to provide 
benefits in those states.72
opposition to the admission of syrians and iraqis would be more understandable if the 
united states had agreed to resettle far larger numbers of refugees. yet its commitment to 
resettle 10,000 syrians in fy 2016 pales in comparison to the nearly five million refugees 
hosted  by  syrias  neighboring  states  and  to  the  generosity  of  germany  and  sweden  in 
entertaining hundreds of thousands of syrian political asylum claims. it also represents a 
substantial retreat from the nations historic leadership in responding to large-scale refugee 
crises. 
terrorist groups seek to terrorize their targets  whether through ruthlessness, technical 
sophistication, or an aura of invincibility  in order to achieve their political, ideological, 
and strategic objectives (brooks 2011, 39-40). communities may be at demonstrably greater 
risk from workplace homicides (ibid., 39), or alcohol-related car crashes,73 but terrorism 
succeeds when it provokes overreaction. while the resilience of targeted communities can 
help  to  diminish  terrorisms  efficacy,  exaggeration  of  a  programs  risks  can  undermine 
security. in fact, as discussed below, the us resettlement program is the most secure us 
admissions program.

b. the us refugee resettlement program 

dhs  has  championed  a  multi-layered,  risk-based  approach  to  security  in  which  each 
layer must be effective in its own right, but there is a high degree of coordination and 
redundancy since no single security measure is foolproof. (9/11 commission 2004, 392). 
former dhs secretaries napolitano and chertoff have characterized the refugee screening 
process  as  thorough  and  robust,  but  not  without  risk.74  vincent  cannistraro,  former 
chief of operations and analysis for the cias counterterrorism center, describes refugee 
resettlement a program in the nations interest and a relatively secure program: 

the united states makes it far more difficult than other countries for a person with 
bad intentions to enter. in addition, the refugee screening and admissions process 
is a more lengthy, difficult and secure process than we have for any other group 
seeking to enter. this program is certainly less of a risk than the normal immigration 
systems for tourists, business people and others.75 

in 2002 and 2003, following the 9/11 attacks, refugee admissions fell sharply as the united 
states undertook a comprehensive review and analysis of the program based on concerns 
that it could be used by terrorists to gain entry into the united states (kerwin and stock 
2007, 389). current refugee screening and admissions policies reflect the hardening and

national security and law enforcement experts believed that program vulnerabilities could 
be sufficiently mitigated (ibid., 405, n.122). more recently, napolitano and chertoff have 
argued that homeland security and refugee protection are not mutually exclusive goals, 
provided that vetting and screening processes remain robust and undiluted.76 
obama administration officials have characterized the refugee program as the most secure 
process for non-citizens seeking admission to the united states.77 indeed, until recent years, 
refugee screening was often criticized for a level of redundancy that put refugees and their 
families at risk for extended periods (hrf 2010, 21-26; kerwin 2012, 6-8).
the  multiplicity  of  institutional  stakeholders  in  the  refugee  screening  and  admissions 
process operate as a check against fraud and terrorist infiltration. moreover, the eligibility 
standard for refugee status is narrow, and refugees can be found inadmissible on security, 
criminal, and other grounds. the us processing priorities and commitment to resettle the 
most vulnerable further limit the refugees considered for admission.78 the cases referred 
by unhcr for us resettlement are highly vulnerable, low-risk persons, including single 
women with children, torture survivors, and persons with special medical needs (sengupta 
2015). roughly 2 percent are single men without us families to receive them.
the us refugee resettlement program enjoys the comparative advantage of being able to 
vet and screen refugees prior to their admission.79 this process is deliberate and thorough 
(brown and scribner, 115-16). because the schedules and periods of validity of security 
and  health  screenings  do  not  perfectly  overlap,  some  screenings  must  be  completed  a 
second time (nezer 2014, 129). applicants also undergo continuous review and recurrent 
vetting, meaning that they can be denied admission based on new information at any point 
in the process. 
unhcr assesses refugee claims and refers persons for resettlement. it interviews potential 
refugees and collects biographic information and biometric data on them: it has collected

embassy, or a designated ngo; (2) p-2 cases which include groups of special humanitarian concern identified 
by the us refugee program (this category has traditionally included religious minorities); and (3) p-3 family 
reunification cases (uscis 2015a). 
79    pushing  the  border  out  became  a  centerpiece  of  post-9/11  immigration  enforcement  and  security 
strategies,  and  rigorous  screening  outside  us  borders  became  one  layer  in  the  defense  against  terrorist 
infiltration.

refugees fall within 45 categories of concern, whether based on their family ties, service 
in particular government ministries or military units, or even being in specific locations 
at specific times (ibid.). according to unhcr officials, almost any flag will scuttle the 
refugees case indefinitely and unhcr screens out at least half of the cases it reviews 
(ibid.). fraud prevention represents one its top priorities (unhcr 2014b  19-20).
the interview process itself  the probing and recording of a refugees story  permits 
credibility assessments. the process also connects a name to biometric data, which helps to 
establish an identity and to promote security moving ahead. screening allows unhcr 
and states to identify the humanitarian and integration needs of refugees for placement 
purposes.
the  state  departments  bureau  of  population,  refugees  and  migration  (dos/prm) 
contracts with resettlement support centers (rsc) to pre-screen persons for admission 
and to prepare cases for review by uscis. rscs collect information for case adjudication 
and security screening, including biographic information that includes name, aliases, date 
of birth, family tree, education, the basis of the persecution claim, and the date and place 
from which the refugee departed. rscs also initiate biographic checks of names (using 
linguistic logarithms), aliases, places of birth, nationalities, and other data against doss 
consular lookout and support system (class). class includes multi-agency records 
with information on intelligence, criminal histories, immigration violations, and potential 
terrorists.80
prior to the uscis interview, the refugee affairs division reviews and refers cases that 
meet certain criteria to usciss fraud detection and national security directorate (fdns), 
which liaises with us intelligence agencies. fdns conducts open-source and classified 
research on referred cases, and produces an assessment for the uscis interviewing officer. 
if the interview raises any red flags, the case is referred again to fdns.  
it may seem counterintuitive, but social media, in particular, can be a very rich source 
of information on terrorists. an estimated 40 percent of persons charged with a jihadist 
terrorist-related offence since 9/11 either posted jihadist content online or used the internet 
in an operational manner (bergen 2016, 135-36). terrorists use social media to organize, 
recruit, and even declare their terrorist affiliations.81 as a result, dhs has been working 
aggressively to enhance its review of the social media footprint of refugees, asylum seekers, 
and visa applicants (nixon 2016).
rscs also initiate security advisory opinions (saos) by law enforcement and intelligence 
agencies. these reviews consist of running the applicants name and other data through 
multiple intelligence and law enforcement databases. thus, they build a level of redundancy 
into the vetting process. the profile of recipients of sao reviews remained the same for

and preston 2015).

reviews are based on criteria that include nationality (roughly 30 nations), gender, and age. 
persons in unclassified categories selected by dos based on us foreign policy interests 
and security concerns also receive sao screening. most reviews are completed within 
45 to 60 days, not an inconsequential period for refugees in desperate, often dangerous 
circumstances. however, in some cases, it can take months for the participating agencies 
to respond. significant delays can result when the name of an intending refugee resembles 
or matches a name in a government database. 
us family ties help to establish a refugees identity and connections. rscs also secure 
sponsorship assurance from domestic resettlement agencies. the more information that 
intelligence and law enforcement agencies gather on an applicant, the more confident they 
can be regarding his or her background and intentions. family and sponsoring agencies 
also facilitate integration by helping refugees find a place to live, secure work, and register 
for school.
uscis reviews refugee applications for eligibility and admissibility. on the day of the 
refugee interview, uscis conducts biometric checks (fingerprints and photographs) against: 
(1) the fbis next generation identification system (ngi), the worlds largest repository of 
criminal records; (2) dhss automated biometric identification system (ident) which 
contains immigration and travel history and records; and (3) the department of defenses 
(dods) automated biometric identification system (abis), which includes biometric 
records from iraq, afghanistan, and other areas of conflict (uscis 2015b).
in 2011, dhs initiated an additional screening process, inter-agency checks (iacs), which 
refugees receive prior to the refugee interview and pre-departure to the united states. the 
national counterterrorism center (nctc) helps to coordinate the review.82 nctc was 
established  in  response  to  a  9/11  commission  recommendation  for  a  center  for  joint 
operational planning and joint intelligence (9/11 commission 2004, 403).
the uscis refugee corps plays an underappreciated role in the vetting process. officers 
receive extensive, specialized training on refugee law, grounds of inadmissibility, fraud 
detection and prevention, security protocols, interviewing techniques, credibility analysis 
and country conditions research.83 prior to deployment, they undergo additional training 

82   nctc connects multiple departments and agencies within the us intelligence community. it falls within 
the office of the director of national intelligence (odni). its mission is to lead us efforts to combat terrorism 
at home and abroad by analyzing the threat, sharing that information with our partners, and integrating all 
instruments of national power to ensure unity of effort (odni 2015). the director of national intelligence 
(dni) heads the us intelligence community, which comprises16 agencies and includes air force intelligence, 
army intelligence, the cia, coast guard intelligence, the defense intelligence agency, the department of

refugee protection policies and national securityon the types of refugee claims they are likely to encounter, detailed country of origin 
information,  and  updates  on  any  fraud  trends  and  security  issues.84 they  also  receive 
expert training on country-specific intelligence issues. 
refugee officers conduct in-depth interviews in which they assess the merits of claims, 
probe and test credibility, and explore potential fraud and security concerns. since 9/11, 
security has been a pervasive dhs priority, including for its uscis refugee corps. 
prior to their departure to the united states, refugees pass through a second inter-agency 
review which seeks to identify new derogatory information. prior to admission, cbp screens 
refugees against its national targeting center-passenger and the transportation security 
administration (tsa) secure flight program. cbp also screens newly arrived refugees for 
admission at ports-of-entry, reviewing their documents and conducting additional security 
checks.
terrorist  information  obtained  during  refugee  screening  is  entered  into  the  terrorist 
identities datamart environment (tides), which includes biographic data, fingerprints, 
and other classified holdings. thus, the refugee program not only benefits from intelligence, 
but contributes to it as well. 
high-ranking fbi, dhs, and nctc officials have lamented deficiencies in intelligence 
collection related to syrian refugees, arguing that effective screening requires datasets that 
contain accurate and thorough information on potential terrorists and criminals (hhsc 
2015, 4). republican presidential candidates and members of congress have interpreted 
these concerns as evidence that the united states cannot vet or run background checks 
against syrian refugees and, thus, should not admit any of them (saddiqui 2015). this is 
not the case.
the united states can collect intelligence more easily from iraq or afghanistan, where it has 
had a large military presence, than from syria. at the same time, its military engagements 
have engendered terrorist blowback. the large numbers of watch-listed iraqis should not 
be viewed as a counterterror triumph. in addition, the lack of us access to information 
from syrian state intelligence and police agencies,85 is not an insurmountable barrier to 
identifying syrian terrorists. 
since 9/11, the united states has created a vast intelligence, counterterror and homeland 
security infrastructure that by 2010 reportedly encompassed 1,271 government organizations 
and  1,931  private  corporations,  and  854,000  persons  with  top-secret  clearances  in  the 
washington,  dc  area  alone  (priest  and arkin  2010).  one  study  found  that  annual  us 
expenditure on homeland security increased by $75 billion between 2001 and 2009 (in 2010 
dollars), including by $50 billion for federal agencies (other than intelligence agencies), 
$15  billion  for  federal  intelligence  agencies,  and  $10  billion  for  states  and  localities 
(stewart, ellingwood and mueller 2011, 373). moreover, this very conservative estimate 
did not account for private sector expenses (ibid., 373). in fy 2015, us intelligence agency

$16.5 billion for the military intelligence program (fas 2016).
the  combined,  enacted  budgets  of  the  two  principal  federal  homeland  security  and 
immigration  enforcement  agencies,  cbp  and  immigration  and  customs  enforcement 
(ice), exceeded $19 billion in 2015 (dhs 2016a, 10). given these immense investments 
and the widely recognized need for better intelligence exposed by the 9/11 attacks, it is no 
surprise that us intelligence agencies have, in fact, generated derogatory information on 
individual syrians seeking admission to the united states.
the known unknown presents a real but manageable challenge for the us screening 
system. previously unknown terrorists can be identified through their associations, travel 
methods, tradecraft, evasiveness, inconsistencies, use of social media, and other means. in 
other words, they can be detected through a rigorous vetting, screening, and admissions 
process. as robert bonner, former cbp commissioner, has said: we are capable of vetting 
. theres certainly the opportunity to make sure that the refugees that we do admit do not 
pose a security threat to our country.86
finally, syrian refugees in europe come from upper middle-class backgrounds at higher 
rates than refugee populations from other nations (mchugh 2015). they include doctors, 
bankers, business people, and other professionals whose identity can be documented 
and well-established (ibid.). they come from a society that prior to civil war served as a 
haven for large numbers of middle eastern refugees, including two million iraqis (polk 
2013), and that ranked among the medium human development states in the 2010 human 
development index (undp 2010, 145). as unhcr and dhs have found, the identity of 
many syrian refugees can be determined with a high degree of confidence. 
in a november 19, 2015 letter to president obama, former dhs secretaries napolitano 
and  chertoff  wrote  that  the  highest  priority  of  our  government  is  to  keep americans 
safe and we can achieve this mission in a manner that is consistent with american values 
of  openness  and  inclusiveness.87  in  particular,  the  united  states  can  admit  the  most 
vulnerable of these refugees  as long as we do not compromise the already established 
protections.88 

vii. policy recommendations 
this paper makes the case that refugee protection and national security should be viewed 
as complementary, not conflicting, state goals. to that end, this section identifies several 
strategies that promote both security and refugee protection. it also outlines steps that the 
us congress should take to enhance us refugee protection policies and security. finally, 
it argues for the efficacy of political engagement in support of pro-protection, pro-security 
policies, and against the assumption that political populism will invariably impede support 
for refugee protection.

refugee protection policies and national securitya. strategies to further national security and refugee protection
as a conceptual matter, national security and refugee protection express the aspiration for 
human safety and well-being, but from different perspectives and with different emphases. 
from  a  practical  perspective,  strategies  to  advance  these  dual  priorities    conflict 
prevention,  peacebuilding,  reconstruction,  reconciliation,  safe  return,  humanitarian  and 
development assistance, and integration  largely align and can re-enforce each other. 
conflict prevention represents a national security priority (white house 2015b, 10), and 
a refugee protection imperative.89 the early and durable resolution of armed conflicts 
(unga  2016    100[e]),  and  reductions  in  conflict,  political  terror,  and  human  rights 
violations can reduce forced migration (shaver and zhou 2015), and avoid the escalating 
series of negative, and often perverse, consequences and growing costs for host countries, 
the international community, and refugees themselves (papademetriou 2015, 8). 
states should commit far greater political and diplomatic capital to resolve the worlds 
multiple refugee-producing crises, which include the syrian and iraqi mega-crisis, the 
ravages of africas first world war centered in the drc, the quarter century of chaos and 
turmoil in somalia, the civil war in south sudan, the sectarian violence in the car, the 
flight of eritreans from poverty and conscription, the breakdown of the rule-of-law in el 
salvador, honduras, and guatemala, the protracted and newly displaced afghani refugees, 
and  the  stateless  rohingya,  among  others. a  national  security  framework  cannot  be 
sustained  without  addressing  the  other  conditions  that  create  human  insecurity  and 
displacement (vietti and scribner 2014, 27).  nor can safe, voluntary return, the preferred 
option for most refugees, be brought to scale as a durable solution without systematically 
addressing refugee-producing conditions.
in  the  un  summit  report  addressing  the  large  movements  of  refugees  and  migrants, 
the  un  secretary-general  urged  states  to  take  concrete  steps  to  uphold  the  safety  and 
dignity of refugees and migrants; to adopt a global compact that would entail greater, 
more integrated and differentiated commitments to refugee protection; and to develop a 
global  compact  for  safe,  regular  and  orderly  migration  (un  secretary-general  2016 
 24-29). the united states has expressed its commitment to expanded and diversified 
state commitments to address this immense human crisis.90 while the language in the un 
report  has  been  watered  down  in  the  summit  outcome  document,  many  of  the  reports 
key ideas have survived. in particular, the idea of a global compact on refugee protection, 
buttressed by concrete state commitments, deserves support from both a refugee protection 
and national security perspective.
developed states should offer orderly and expanded access to their own territories. they 
should  also  increase  opportunities  for  protection  through  greater  use  of  humanitarian, 
medical, family, student, labor, and private resettlement channels (un secretary-general 

89   moreover, many conflicts and other refugee-producing conditions can be anticipated (rupp 2016, 81). 
90   the united states has announced that it will seek to identify an additional 10 states to contribute regularly 
to un humanitarian appeals and agencies, to secure a 30 percent increase in state commitments for this work 
(from $10 billion in 2015 to $13 billion in 2016), to double the number of refugee resettlement or other legal 
avenues of admission worldwide, and to expand refugee education and employment opportunities by one 
million persons in each of 10 refugee host states (campbell 2016). 

118

journal on migration and human security2016    83).91  legal  migration  contributes  to  security  by  denying  traffickers  access  to 
vulnerable  persons,  preventing  crossing  deaths,  and  allowing  states  to  identify  persons 
seeking admission and to concentrate their resources on bad actors. by contrast, terrorists 
often  profit  from  and  occasionally  control  criminal  smuggling  rings  (adamson  2006, 
178;  schmid  2016,  27-28).  smugglers  and  traffickers  flourish  when  the  demand  for 
opportunities to immigrate outstrips the supply provided by official channels (adamson 
2006, 193). in order to minimize criminally organized flows, states should align their legal 
migration policies with their own socio-economic interests. they should also regularly 
legalize unauthorized populations. 
the threat of terrorist recruitment, conscription and violence speaks to the need to safeguard 
refugees in camps and urban settings, the need to expand and expedite durable solutions, and 
the need to extend legal migration channels to refugees. in addition, greater educational and 
employment opportunities can immunize refugees from terrorist propaganda and diminish 
onward migration, while affording them portable skills (un secretary-general 2016  82).
developed  states  should  provide  far  greater  support  to  refugee  hosting  states  for  both 
humanitarian  and  security  reasons.  the  latter  states  can  serve  as  a  bulwark  against 
extremism and dangerous, unregulated migration. with appropriate support, they can offer 
development opportunities to all of their residents (including refugees) and, thus, increase 
the prospects for refugee integration. 
terrorists seek to radicalize socially disenfranchised youth and young adults in western 
states (iep 2015, 69). in response, states and civil society should prioritize youth education, 
employment, socially inclusive policies, and holistic policing strategies (iep 2015, 74). 
the literature on immigrant integration illustrates that the policies, values, and prejudices 
of receiving communities strongly influence integration outcomes (portes and zhou 1993, 
83).92 thus, host states should adopt strong and inclusive policies for their refugee and 
forcibly displaced populations.
integration  also  demands  a  commitment  by  refugees  and  asylees  to  the  core,  rights-
respecting values and laws of receiving states. extremist groups, by contrast, seek to create 
homogeneous societies: they reject pluralism and minority rights, and view the rule-of-
law as an impediment to their goals (schmid 2016, 8-9).93  
an  integrated  response  to  refugee  integration  is  also  a  hallmark  of  effective  policies: 
integration between state agencies; between localities, states, supranational, and international

92   the reception of refugees, asylees and their children may well have a greater influence on the receptivity 
of these populations to violent extremism than their nations of origin or ancestry (bolifrass, shaver, and zhou 
2015).

for rights of minorities, rule of law, human rights, separation of state and religion, gender equality, freedom 
of thought and religion, social solidarity, pluralist acceptance of diversity and mutual tolerance (schmid 
2016, 51).

refugee protection policies and national securitybodies; and between government, the private sector, and ngos (un secretary-general 
2016  114[a]). similarly, counterterrorism requires the integrated use of all elements 
of national power, including diplomacy, intelligence, covert action, law enforcement, 
economic policy, foreign aid, public diplomacy, and homeland defense (9/11 commission 
2004, 205). 
states whose members are targeted for terrorist recruitment should also prioritize countering 
violent extremism (cve).94 as part of its national security strategy, for example, the 
united  states  has  committed  to  addressing  the  underlying  conditions  that  can  help 
foster violent extremism and to support alternatives to extremist messaging and greater 
economic opportunities for women and disaffected youth (white house 2015b, 9). these 
important goals need to be operationalized.95
the  success  of  cve  programs  depends,  in  part,  on  their  responsiveness  to  the  diverse 
contexts  and  motivations  of  terrorist  recruits,96  and  on  engagement  of  these  programs 
with family, school, law enforcement, and other community institutions.97 an analysis of 
counter-radicalization programs in the united kingdom, the netherlands, denmark and 
norway found that programs that targeted at risk persons or those already on a path to 
radicalization were more effective than broad, preventive initiatives (vidino and brandon 
2012,  70).  cve  initiatives  can  be  difficult  to  assess  given  the  difficulties  in  proving 
prevention or abandonment of an ideology or affiliation (schmid 2016, 45-54). however, 
they should nonetheless be targeted, context-specific, and rigorously evaluated.
liberal  democracies  have  historically  treated  migration  from  totalitarian  states  as  an 
expression of the aspiration for freedom by persons who would otherwise be consigned 
to lives of repression and poverty. these concerns are not implicated in cases of persons 
seeking to join a terrorist organization or to evade arrest for domestic or overseas terrorist 
activity. returning jihadists, in particular, should receive exhaustive screening, with an 
eye toward determining which of a continuum of responses to impose, from release and 
surveillance  to  criminal  prosecution  and,  in  extreme  circumstances,  to  revocation  of 
citizenship through judicial proceedings.98 
robust refugee and migrant vetting procedures can advance national security and pave the 
way for generous refugee protection policies. in the post-9/11 era, the united states has 
sought to secure mobility through: 
94    the  related  term  counter-radicalization  has  been  described  as  a  catch  all  that  encompasses  de-
radicalization  (to  abandon  ones  radical  views),  disengagement  (to  abandon  a  terrorist  affiliation  and 
activities, if not its ideology), and radicalization prevention (which targets a particular segment of society 
whose members may be vulnerable to radicalization) (vidino and brandon 2012, 9). 
95   to  that  end,  in  2015,  the  united  states  hosted  national  and  regional  summits  on  countering  violent 
extremism (cve). in may 2016, it released a strategy document describing its priorities in this area. cve 
initiatives seek to eliminate or minimize the factors that cause members of targeted communities to join or 
support terrorist organizations (schmid 2016, 53-54). 
96   a study of 2,032 persons who fought for al qaeda broke down their motivations into four categories, 
identity seeking (40 percent), revenge seeking (30 percent), status seeking (25 percent), and thrill seeking (5 
percent) (iep 2015, 73).
97    under  the  us  strategy,  cve  encompasses  not  just  prevention,  but  rehabilitation  and  reintegration 
programs (dos and usaid 2016, 7). 
98   denaturalization might be fitting, for example, in cases of hardened terrorists, war criminals, and others 
who were granted citizenship based on willful misrepresentation.

intelligence collection;
expanded and accurate terrorist and criminal databases;
information sharing within and between states;
secure, biometrically enhanced identity documents;99
layered  screening,  including  interviews  to  assess  eligibility  for  admission  and 
credibility;
enhanced background checks on migrants who meet evidence-based profiles;
strategies that enlist public support and advance national unity; and
continuous assessment of terrorist threats, tactics, and methods. 

many  states  cannot  afford  such  an  extensive  vetting  and  screening  regime.  however, 
the  severe,  sometimes  existential  threat  posed  by  transnational  terrorists  and  criminal 
organizations  to  fragile  states  argues  for  increased  levels  of  interstate  cooperation  in 
the  form  of  intelligence  collection,  information  sharing,  law  enforcement  support,  and 
regulated migration (adamson 2006, 198). 
while potentially an important point of exposure and vulnerability for terrorists, borders 
should not be the sole or main locus for identifying terrorists or preventing their entry. in 
addition, the level of investment in border and immigration enforcement policies should 
be subjected to risk management principles. enforcement agencies should not be charged 
with screening refugees and migrants for protection. however, if they are vested with these 
responsibilities, an independent, specially trained unit should be created for this purpose. 

b. proposals to strengthen and secure the us refugee protection 

system 
the us congress should take six steps to strengthen the us refugee protection system 
and national security. first, congress should create a single, principal point of oversight 
and review for homeland security (9/11 commission 2004, 421). on the 10th anniversary 
of  the  attacks,  the  national  security  preparedness  group  (nspg)  composed  of  9/11 
commission  members  reported  that  dysfunctional  congressional  oversight  had  created 
gross inefficiencies and security vulnerabilities. the nspg found that dhs answered to 
more than 100 committees and subcommittees and, in 2009 and 2010, provided more 
than 3,900 briefings and testified more than 285 times (nspg 2011, 16). as a result, 
dhs operates under unclear security policies, duplicates efforts, receives conflicting 
guidance, and has not successfully integrated its constituent parts (ibid.) 
according to james ziglar, the failure of congress to have a focused oversight strategy 
for dhs actually endangers our national security interests by forcing dhs to respond to 
the policy and political interests of hundreds of members of congress (and committees), 
as well as the increased risk of disclosure of confidential and classified information in the 
hands of so many members.100 ziglar argues that dhss responsibilities are as important 
as those of us intelligence agencies, yet the congress refuses to manage the oversight 
of dhs with the same seriousness as it does with the intelligence agencies.101 congress 

99   identity assurance can also increase the efficiency of humanitarian and resettlement assistance.

121

refugee protection policies and national securityshould move with alacrity to streamline its oversight of the nations homeland security 
agency.
second, congress should ensure that dhs creates a unified command structure to respond 
to terrorist attacks and other catastrophic events that implicate multiple jurisdictions and 
agencies (nspg 2011, 12-13). just as integration between diverse government agencies 
is central to preventing terrorism, so too can an integrated response to terrorist attacks 
minimize their impact and transform them into an occasion for national unity. 
third, as stipulated in the refugee act of 1980, congress should also create a presidentially 
appointed  us  coordinator  for  refugee  affairs  to  develop  refugee  policy,  coordinate 
admission  and  resettlement  programs,  and  serve  as  a  liaison  to  foreign  governments, 
congress, relevant federal agencies, state and local governments, and ngos.102 given the 
high degree of interest in and misinformation related to the refugee program, the time is 
ripe to create such a position. 

as it stands, the united states cannot credibly deny 

admission to desperate, well-vetted refugees on 

security-related grounds, but allow potential terrorists 

to purchase firearms and explosives

fourth, congress should pass legislation to prevent suspected terrorists from purchasing 
firearms and explosives, while permitting those who wish to purchase firearms and are 
incorrectly on the fbis terrorist watch list to clear their names in an expedited way. isis 
has identified us firearm policies as a source of vulnerability to the united states (taylor 
2016). the fbi operates the national instant criminal background check system (nics), 
which allows federal, state, and local law enforcement to conduct checks on persons seeking 
to purchase firearms or to secure a permit to obtain, sell, or transfer explosives. nics 
searches the fbis national crime information center (ncic) database, which contains 
information on persons wanted by federal, state, and local law enforcement, and the 
fbis consolidated terrorist screening database. as the law stands, felons, fugitives, and 
persons without immigration status cannot purchase firearms or explosives in the united 
states, but suspected terrorists can.
in  march  2015,  the  us  government  accountability  office  (gao)  reported  that  from 
february 2004 through 2014, persons on the terrorist watch list were involved in firearm 
or explosives background checks 2,233 times and that 2,043 (about 91 percent) of the 
transactions were allowed to proceed ... (gaoa 2015). the fbi can use information on an 
attempted purchase in its counterterror investigations. however, it does not always know 
if suspected terrorists have actually obtained firearms or a license or permit for explosives 
because gun and explosives dealers must keep this information, but need not report it (gao 
2010, 4). 
despite  strong  public  support,  bills  to  allow  potential  gun  purchasers  to  challenge  an 
incorrect terrorist watch list designation and to prevent terrorists from purchasing firearms 
and explosives have been reliably defeated (ingraham 2015; ingraham 2016), including 
102   refugee act of 1980, pub. l. no. 96-212, 94 stat. 102  301 (1980).

122

journal on migration and human securityby the us senate on december 3, 2015 (after the san bernardino attack) and on june 20, 
2016 (after the orlando attack by a us citizen formerly on a terrorist watch list). congress 
should pass bipartisan legislation to address these dual imperatives. as it stands, the united 
states  cannot  credibly  deny  admission  to  desperate,  well-vetted  refugees  on  security-
related grounds, but allow potential terrorists to purchase firearms and explosives. nor 
should it deny the right to purchase firearms to persons mistakenly or incorrectly placed on 
the terrorist watch list.
fifth,  congress  should  depoliticize  its  oversight  of  the  us  refugee  program. the  need 
for  generous  refugee  protection  policies  and  for  a  rational  assessment  of  their  security 
vulnerabilities has never been so great. it represents an exercise in cynicism to conflate 
persons who have fled for their lives, with the terrorist groups who, in many cases, prompted 
their flights, or to portray the interests of those seeking protection as at odds with citizens 
who  expect  to  be  safe  and  secure  in  their  own  nations.  like  national  security,  refugee 
protection should be a valence issue, supported across the political spectrum and debated 
on the level of strategy and tactics. 

effective responses to large-scale refugee crises have 

invariably resulted from political leadership, strong domestic 
constituencies, and a high level of public understanding and 

acceptance of those seeking protection

sixth,  while  100  percent  security  cannot  be  guaranteed,  the  us  refugee  resettlement 
program is highly securitized.103 the response to a security breach in this program should 
not be a bar on the admission of desperate people. instead, it should be an exhaustive 
review of whether officials rigorously followed all the steps in the vetting and screening 
process. if they did not, quality control and oversight need to be improved. if they did, 
previously unrecognized vulnerabilities need to be immediately remedied. as a matter of 
course, refugee and international migration policies should be continuously assessed and, 
if necessary, strengthened based on evolving intelligence on terrorist intentions, methods 
and tactics.

c. making refugee protection a popular cause

it is a central paradox in the debate over refugee protection and security that effective 
protection  policies  can  further  security,  but  security-driven  fears  often  impede  their 
adoption. many policymakers, commentators, and advocates attribute hostility to refugees 
and other forcibly displaced persons to political populism, stoked by demagogues. extremist 
political movements have been on the ascent in europe and the united states (troianovski 
2016). these movements criticize what they perceive to be collusion between the press 
and the political elite. they maintain that islam is incompatible with liberal democracy, 
challenge the legitimacy of state institutions, oppose the putative loss of sovereignty to 
supranational and international institutions, and support generous social welfare policies

counter-terrorism center (nov. 20, 2015).

123

refugee protection policies and national securityfor natives. they seek an exclusive kind of order and security that diminishes the prospects 
for security for refugees and other forcibly displaced persons.  
national defense and public safety represent core responsibilities of sovereign states. yet 
as reflected in a succession of seminal human rights instruments since world war ii, states 
also  exist  to  safeguard  the  rights  of  their  citizens  at  home  and  abroad,  non-citizens  in 
transit, persons fleeing persecution at their borders, refugees and immigrants who settle in 
their territories and (in limited circumstances) imperiled person beyond their borders (un 
secretary-general 2016  13, 54). 
the  debate  over  how  to  reconcile  these  broad  responsibilities  will  remain  messy  and 
fraught, but it must be engaged politically and cannot remain a debate between refugee 
protection and national security. refugee resettlement and admission policies arise from 
political  commitments,  not  from  international  legal  commitments.  effective  responses 
to  large-scale  refugee  crises  have  invariably  resulted  from  political  leadership,  strong 
domestic constituencies, and a high level of public understanding and acceptance of those 
seeking protection. it seems trite to make the case that public opinion matters for refugee 
protection, but in fact it does. moreover, public opinion surveys,104 and the great generosity 
of many host communities offer abundant evidence of public support for refugees. the need 
is not to extinguish populist politics, but to educate the public on the interconnectedness of 
refugee protection and security, and to make protection a popular cause.  

104   eighty percent of respondents in a global survey of 27,000 persons in 27 nations said they would accept 
persons fleeing war or persecution into their countries, 10 percent said they would accept such persons into 
their homes,73 percent believed that such persons should be able to take refuge in other countries, and 66 
percent said that states should do more to help persons fleeing war or persecution (amnesty 2016).
