executive summary
this  paper  uses  new  york  citys  consideration  of  an  amendment  to  its 
charter that would extend voting rights to noncitizens in municipal elections 
as a case study in immigrant integration and local governance.  it argues 
that  new  york  citys  biggest  challenge  in  moving  this  issue  forward  is 
dealing successfully with two related questions: (1) why the new york city 
council should be able to decide who the people are without approval 
from the state government in albany and (2) whether it should attempt to 
enact the measure without a referendum. 
the  analysis  first  examines  the  role  of  local  government  in  regulating 
the lives of immigrants, contrasting enforcement-oriented strategies with 
those  that  are  more  integration-oriented.  it  then  spotlights  federal  law 
obstacles  to  noncitizen  suffrage,  concluding  that  while  neither  federal 
criminal  nor  immigration  law  prevents  state  or  local  governments  from 
extending the franchise to noncitizens in state or local matters, federal law 
imposes impediments that may deter some noncitizens from registering 
or that could carry serious immigration consequences for those who vote 
in violation of federal law. the article then focuses on state law obstacles, 
including new yorks constitution, its state election law and its home rule 
provisions. it contrasts other recent experiences with noncitizen suffrage 
around the country, looking at both municipal and school board elections. 
finally,  it  provides  some  thoughts  on  best  practices  in  moving  forward 
the issue of noncitizen suffrage in new york city and other locales. new 
york  law  is  ambiguous  enough  that  good  arguments  can  be  made  for 
why  neither  albanys  approval  nor  a  city-wide  referendum  is  required. 

1  i would like to thank professor lenni benson of new york law school for her invitation to participate in 
a panel discussion on noncitizen voting before the new york city bar on june 24, 2014.  i also thank steven 
sacco, esq., of the new york city bar for arranging my visit and coordinating the panel discussion, and 
professor ron hayduk of queens college for his thoughtful scholarship and tireless advocacy on this issue.

state legislatures power to preempt local law on election matters, if the 
city council attempts to expand the franchise to noncitizen voters without 
a referendum or comparable measure, it could trigger preemptive action in 
albany or lengthy, divisive, and costly battles in the courts.

introduction
new york city is a global city of 8.4 million inhabitants that over 3 million immigrants 
from 148 different countries call home (dinapoli 2010). while many are legal residents 
and naturalized us citizens, many others are here on work or student visas, or enjoy some 
other form of temporary status or authorization; approximately 500,000 are unauthorized.2 
by 2010, 43 percent of new york citys workforce were immigrants occupying a range of 
positions across the economic spectrum (dinapoli 2010). new york states constitution 
specifically states that every local government  shall have a legislative body elective by 
the people thereof.3  new york citys definition of who its people are is likely to be very 
different than in other parts of the state. who gets to decide who that includes?  
whether the new york city council could or should extend the franchise in local elections 
to noncitizen legal residents was before the council for nearly two-and-a-half years before 
it made progress in the spring of 2013.  introduced by the council on november 17, 2010, 
the bill, intro 410, initially enjoyed 31 co-sponsors (out of 51 city councilmembers).4 the 
measure would have created a new category of municipal voter, defined essentially as a 
noncitizen lawfully present in the united states who has resided in new york city for 
at least six months.5  municipal voters would be eligible to participate in any municipal 
election  for  mayor,  city  councilmember,  borough  president,  comptroller,  and/or  public 
advocate,  and  in  all  municipal  ballot  measures,  including  primary,  special  and  general 
elections.6

of the public testified.7 although most witnesses spoke in support of the measure, several 
individuals  from  the  city  government,  including  then-mayor  bloombergs  office,  the 
board of elections, and the campaign finance board, raised concerns about the measures 
constitutionality  and  feasibility.8    bloombergs  office  and  the  board  of  elections  came 
out against the proposal.9 although at one point the bill enjoyed a veto-proof majority, 
before it could come for a vote, several councilmembers withdrew their support.10 without 
a super-majority of two-thirds of the council, or 34 councilmembers, and in light of mayor 
bloombergs stated opposition, the bill was laid over in committee, dying at the end of the 
legislative session on december 31, 2013.11  
during the summer of 2014, and with a new mayor in place, the city council moved forward 
with plans to reintroduce noncitizen suffrage.12 on june 26, the city council, with mayor 
de blasios blessing, voted 43-3 to make municipal id cards available to all new york city 
residents, including an estimated 500,000 unauthorized persons (goldman 2014). the latter 
measure was designed not only to provide the unauthorized with a form of identification 
that would allow them to access city services, rent apartments and open bank accounts, 
but to assist other vulnerable populations as well, including the homeless, the elderly, and 
transgendered persons, who would be able to self-identify their gender (ibid.). early the 
week before, state senator gustavo rivera from the bronx introduced the new york is 
home act into the new york state legislature (eidelson 2014).13 the bill would grant state 
citizenship, including the right to vote in local and state elections, to noncitizens who have 
lived in new york and paid taxes for at least three years.14 conceptions of citizenship, 
membership and belonging appeared to be changing in new york city, if not the entire 
state.15

reconceiving citizenship: noncitizen voting in new york cityon june 24, 2014, on primary day in new york city, the new york city bar hosted a 
panel discussion, open to the public, on intro 410. 16 academics, government officials, and 
advocates examined the legal and policy dimensions of noncitizen suffrage in municipal 
elections.  sebastian maguire, councilman daniel dromms legal counsel, indicated during 
the discussion that the city council hoped to reintroduce the legislation that session, once 
it had garnered sufficient support from the council.17 ron hayduk, an expert in noncitizen 
suffrage and a professor of political science at the city university of new york, queens, 
examined why this measure should be seen as a restoration of noncitizen voting rights 
in light of the long history of noncitizen voting in this country from 1776 to 1926 and 
in new york city school board elections from 1969 to 2003.18 the author of this paper 
offered an objective assessment of new york constitutional, state and municipal law and 
spoke on the implications of federal criminal law, immigration law and integration policy 
for noncitizen suffrage. in a discussion session led by dick dadey, executive director 
of citizens union, jerry vatamala, a lawyer with the asian american legal defense and 
education fund, made the legal arguments for why the city council had the power to enact 
intro 410.19 sebastian maguire provided an update on the current status of the proposal.20 
eric friedman from the new york city campaign finance board discussed some of the 
administrative challenges that the board of elections would likely face in implementing 
noncitizen suffrage if it came to pass.21 while generally supportive, some members of the 
audience raised questions and concerns regarding the measures scope.  
this paper provides a case study on noncitizen suffrage in the city of new york which 
revisits the legal and policy issues raised in the authors presentation while incorporating 
the perspectives of co-panelists and the work of legal academics on the special role local 
entities can play in integrating immigrants into the social fabric of a community.22 it seeks 
to disentangle the threads of law, history, government, and immigration policy which are 

from new york city.  see summary, new york is home act, http://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?default_fld=&

journal on migration and human securityintertwined in this case and to offer some thoughts and recommendations on moving the 
issue of noncitizen voting in new york city forward. it identifies and assesses the legal 
obstacles to noncitizen suffrage in municipal elections in new york city, including federal 
criminal  and  immigration  law,  and  state  law  obstacles.  it  concludes  that  while  neither 
federal criminal law nor immigration law prevent state or local governments from extending 
the franchise to noncitizens in state or local matters, federal law imposes impediments 
that may deter some noncitizens from registering or that could carry serious immigration 
consequences for those who vote in violation of federal law.23  
part i examines the role of local government in general and in new york city in particular 
in  regulating  the  lives  of  immigrants,  contrasting  enforcement-oriented  strategies  with 
those  that  are  integration-oriented,  building  on  the  work  of  heather  gerken,  hiroshi 
motomura,  cristina  rodrguez,  and  others.24  part  ii  spotlights  federal  law  obstacles  to 
noncitizen suffrage, looking at both federal criminal law and the immigration grounds of 
inadmissibility  and  deportability.25  part  iii  focuses  on  state  law  obstacles  to  noncitizen 
suffrage,  including  new  yorks  constitution,  its  state  election  law  and  its  home  rule 
provisions.26 part iv discusses other recent experiences with noncitizen suffrage, both in 
municipal elections and other more localized elections, like school board elections.27 it 
examines both successful and unsuccessful efforts throughout the country and evaluates 
the costs and benefits of attempting to extend the franchise to noncitizens.  part v provides 
some thoughts on advancing the issue of noncitizen suffrage in new york city and other 
locales.  
during the hearings on intro 410 in may 2013, steven richman from the board of elections 
indicated that the board opposed intro 410 in part in the belief that it would violate state 
election law, which limits the franchise to us citizens.28 the electorate, however, as defined 
by state law, does not always coincide with the people of a particular community. of new 
york citys estimated population of 8.4 million inhabitants, approximately 1.3 million are 
believed to be noncitizens.29 in many of new york citys 51 districts, the percentage of 
noncitizens is much higher and in several districts immigrants make up close to a majority 
of  residents.30  moreover,  from  a  legal  standpoint,  new  york  citys  election  law  and 
home rule provisions allow for local enactments to trump state election law under certain 
circumstances.31 as david andersson from the voting rights coalition asked during those

reconceiving citizenship: noncitizen voting in new york citysame hearings, do we want a city with a small voting population and an ever-growing 
number of marginalized and disenfranchised people?32 with a new mayor and city council, 
noncitizen suffrage in municipal elections in new york city is a proposal whose time may 
have come. 
this paper argues that the city councils biggest challenge in moving this issue forward is 
dealing successfully with two related questions: (1) why the city council should be able 
to decide who the people are without approval from albany and (2) whether it should 
attempt to enact intro 410 without a referendum.  after reviewing other recent experiences 
with noncitizen voting, it concludes that while new york law does not prevent the city 
council from enacting intro 410 without approval from albany, a city-wide referendum 
may  be  necessary  and  advisable. at  the  very  least,  the  city  council  should  engage  the 
people of new york city directly on this matter, such as through mini-town hall meetings or 
listening sessions in the 51 districts.33 new york election laws and home rule statutes, when 
read together, are ambiguous enough that good arguments can be made for why neither 
albanys approval nor a city-wide referendum is required.34 nonetheless, given new york 
citys historic relationship with the state legislature and its power to preempt local law on 
election matters,35 if the city council attempts to expand the franchise to noncitizen voters 
without a city-wide referendum or comparable measure, it could trigger preemptive action 
in albany, or lengthy, divisive, and costly battles in the courts.36  

i.  immigrant integration and local government
immigrant integration is a distinctly local matter. it is at the local level that people work, seek 
police protection, send children to school, and advocate for safer, healthier, neighborhoods 
(rodrguez  2008,  571;  motomura  2014,  165).  although  immigrant  integration  occurs 
in  the  shadow  of  federal  immigration  enforcement,  it  is  problematic  for  the  national 
government, or, for that matter, states, to dictate integration policies from the top down.37 
policies that may make sense in a global city like new york city or chicago, such as 
noncitizen participation on local school boards or neighborhood councils, may meet with 
great resistance in a more insular community, like lewiston, maine or parts of upstate new 
york (gilbert 2009).  
as  cristina  rodrguez  writes,  management  of  immigration  is  a  multi-sovereign  task, 
requiring complementary roles for national, state and local actors (rodrguez 2008, 610). 
this  is  even  truer  today.  given  the  federal  governments  inability  to  reach  a  national 
solution on immigration reform, states and local governments have taken the regulation 
he is a citizen of the united states and is or will be, on the day of such election, eighteen years of age or over, 
and a resident of this state and of the county, city or village for a minimum of thirty days next preceding such 
election); new york statute of local governments,  2, 10-11.

228

journal on migration and human securityof  immigrants  into  their  own  hands  (gilbert  2012).  some  policies,  like arizonas  sb 
1070, are enforcement-oriented.38 in contrast, other state and local authorities invoke anti-
commandeering rules to justify their refusal to enforce federal immigration law (see, e.g., 
lasch 2013). still others are adopting measures to incorporate immigrants into the life of a 
community, such as through in-state tuition benefits, drivers licenses, id cards, and other 
privileges of membership (motomura 2014, 59). 
powerful reasons exist for allowing new york city to extend the suffrage to noncitizens in 
municipal elections without waiting for permission from the state legislature or for a state-
wide measure, like the new york is home act introduced in june 2014. just as federal 
immigration law should not presumably trump state and local integration efforts,39,40 state 
laws should not automatically override or impede local efforts. yet while us constitutional 
law protects states against commandeering by the federal government, which prohibits the 
federal government from ordering the states to either adopt a federal regulatory scheme or 
enforce federal law,41 local governments only enjoy such autonomy as a states constitution 
or laws provide (rodrguez 2008, 637; see also frug and barron 2006). just as states can 
serve  as  labs,  however,  so  can  local  governmental  entities. while  states  have  a  crucial 
role to play in setting baselines in areas like workers rights, public safety, voting rights, 
health, and education, communities are strengthened if they are supported and encouraged 
to develop their own solutions to local problems (see gerken 2010, 23-4; cf. gordon 1996; 
briffault 1994). fortunately for the people of new york city, neither federal law nor new 
york state law prevents new york city from extending the franchise to noncitizens in 
municipal elections, as the next two sections will demonstrate.  

ii.  federal obstacles to noncitizen suffrage
this  section  will  address  issues  of  federal  law  raised  by  intro  410  and  any  successor 
legislation. the main point is that although federal law does not prevent new york city from 
extending voting rights to noncitizens in local elections, it does carry certain consequences 
that could act as a deterrent to voting or, even worse, imperil voters immigration status. 
federal law criminalizes noncitizen voting in federal elections, unless (1) the election is 
also held for some other state or local purpose, (2) noncitizens have been authorized to vote 

38   motomura  draws  distinction  between  direct  and  indirect  involvement  by  state  and  local  actors  with 
immigration  law,  and  distinguishing  measures  that  are  enforcement-oriented  from  measures  to  either 
neutralize or remain neutral in enforcement (2014, 57-9).  
39   see  wyeth  v.  levine,  129  s.  ct.  1187,  1194-95  (2009);  see  also  riegel  v.  medtronic,  inc.,  552  u.s. 
312, 334-37 (2008) (ginsburg, j. dissenting) (criticizing majority for not applying a presumption against 
preemption); bates v. dow agrosciences llc, 544 u.s. 431, 449 (2005) (where the text of a preemption 
clause is open to more than one plausible reading, courts ordinarily accept the reading that disfavors pre-
emption); medtronic inc. v. lohr, 518 u.s. 470 (1996) (courts have long presumed that congress does 
not cavalierly preempt state law causes of action); jones v. rath packing co., 430 u.s. 519 (1977) (this 
assumption provides assurance that the federal balance will not be disturbed unintentionally by congress 
or unnecessarily by the courts); rice v. santa fe elevator corp., 331 u.s. 218, 230 (1947) (preemption 
analysis starts with assumption that the historic police powers of the states [a]re not to be superseded  
unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress). 
40  see also rodrguez 2008, arguing that if we did away with federal exclusivity in immigration matters, 
federal alienage distinctions would lose their presumptive rationality (629-30).

reconceiving citizenship: noncitizen voting in new york cityunder the states constitution, state law or a local ordinance, and 3) voting is conducted 
so as to ensure that a noncitizen can vote for such other purpose, but not in the federal 
matter.42 in short, federal law explicitly recognizes that a state or local government can 
extend suffrage to noncitizens, at least with regard to a state or local matter, as long as 
the relevant government body develops procedures to ensure that the noncitizen cannot 
vote on the federal matter.43 this might be done either by giving noncitizens a different 
ballot, or by holding local elections at a different time. at the same time, immigration law 
makes a noncitizen who votes in violation of any federal, state or local law inadmissible 
or deportable.44  
how might this happen? intro 410 defines municipal voters broadly in terms of persons 
lawfully present under the immigration laws.45 this includes not only green card holders, 
but also persons here indefinitely on work visas, students, asylum applicants, and recipients 
of  deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca).46 the authors of intro 410 recognized 
that limiting voting rights to lawful permanent residents would exclude many persons who 
may be as much on a pathway to citizenship as permanent residents, even if the pathway is 
longer and more contingent.47 for example, if s. 744, the immigration reform bill passed 
by the us senate in june 2013, had become law, most registered provisional immigrants 
(rpis) would have had to wait ten years before becoming lawful permanent residents 
and another three years before applying for us citizenship.48 however, many persons who 
are now lawfully present, particularly persons with deferred action status or temporary 
visas, could become inadmissible or deportable or even subject to prosecution if they vote 
after their lawful presence expires, or even if they use the wrong ballot.49 so, as witnesses 
underscored, the board of elections will need to come up with measures to minimize these 
dangers, such as through ballot design, training of poll workers, and educating noncitizen 
voters about the process of voting and perils of voting in violation of the rules.50

journal on migration and human securityiii.  state law obstacles to noncitizen suffrage
one major question is whether new york city can adopt intro 410 without approval from 
the  state  legislature.  this  has  been  the  sticking  point  in  massachusetts,  where  various 
cities, including cambridge, brookline, wayland, and amherst, have enacted noncitizen 
voting laws but, despite repeated attempts, the state has thus far failed to enact enabling 
legislation.51,52 the same legal obstacles do not currently exist under new york law.  first, 
new yorks constitution poses no obstacle.  although it protects the voting rights of us 
citizens over 18 who meet new yorks residency requirement, it does not limit the franchise 
to them.53 as jerry vatamala, staff attorney for the asian american legal defense and 
education  fund,  persuasively  argued  before  the  city  council,  new  yorks  constitution 
establishes a baseline or floor, not a ceiling.54 for example, while new york city could 
extend  the  franchise  in  municipal  elections  to  sixteen  year  olds  without  violating  new 
yorks constitution, it could not set 21 as the minimum age.  
new york state election law does, however, limit the franchise in any election to us 
citizens.  the language in the statute, unlike the language in new yorks constitution, is 
prohibitory.  on the qualification of voters it provides that

no person shall be qualified to register for and vote at any election unless he is a citizen 
of the united states and is or will be, on the day of such election, eighteen years of age 
or over, and a resident of this state and of the county, city or village for a minimum of 
thirty days next preceding such election.55 

new yorks  election law  also  provides,  however,  that if  a  conflict exists  between  state 
election law and any other law, the latter prevails unless the election law specifically 
provides that it should prevail.56  known in preemption parlance as a savings clause or 
reverse preemption provision, this language creates a presumption against preemption 

51  a report prepared by the department of urban and environmental policy and planning of tufts university 
for the massachusetts immigrant and refugee advocacy coalition and the cambridge immigrant voting 
rights  campaign  concluded  that  in  the  current  political  climate  enabling  legislation  was  not  feasible 
(castagna et al. 2005, 1-3).

reconceiving citizenship: noncitizen voting in new york cityunless the new york state legislature makes its intent to preempt local law unmistakably 
clear (gilbert 2012, 160-61, 170).57   
the  state  legislature  easily  could  have  included  preemptive  language  such  as 
notwithstanding any state or local enactment to the contrary  in  5-102, the provision 
quoted above.  such language arguably would have prevented local governments from 
extending the franchise to noncitizens (or to sixteen year olds).58 it has not done so.59 intro 
410 could raise policy concerns in albany and result in state legislative action to limit local 
governments power to expand the franchise. but even if albany has the authority to do so, 
in light of the savings clause in  1-102 of new yorks election law, it would have to do so 
explicitly.60   
the more difficult question is whether the new york city council can or should adopt 
intro 410 on its own, or whether a referendum is necessary or advisable. in 2013, mayor 
bloombergs office also opposed intro 410 on the basis that, even if not contrary to new 
yorks constitution or its election law, under new yorks home rule statute and the city 
charter, any expansion of the franchise had to be via referendum.61 section 23(2)(e) of new 
yorks municipal home rule law, along with  38 of new york citys charter, provides 
that a local law shall be subject to mandatory referendum if it [a]bolishes an elective 
office, or changes the method of  electing  an elective officer, or changes the term of  

57   see also opinion letter from aziz huq & wendy weiser, associate counsel, brennan center for justice, 
nyu school of law, feb. 2, 2005 (concluding that the new york city council has the authority to adopt 
noncitizen voting in municipal elections without authorization from albany)(on file with author).  
58  there is also an argument that this is not an area where the state can limit local governments power. 
however, a careful reading of new york election law together with new yorks home rule statute indicates 
that while extension of the franchise in municipal elections is not an area where local governments have been 
excluded from legislating, it is also not an area where this local power is guaranteed. new yorks home rule 
statute reserves to the state legislature the power to enact laws in certain specified areas, notwithstanding the 
fact that they impair, diminish or repeal the powers of local government. n.y. statute of local government, 
 11. this includes inter alia [a]ny law relating to a matter other than the property, affairs or government of 
a local government. id. at 11(4) (emphasis added). since noncitizen voting on matters of municipal concern 
relates to local government affairs, this would be an area where there is a presumption against preemption 
of local law. that does not mean, however, that the presumption is irrebuttable if it otherwise falls within the 
states power. see n.y. statute of local government  20(1) (indicating that a matter can still relate to the 
property, affairs or government of local government, even where it falls within the states power to legislate). 
59  n.y. statute of local government,  11, in reserving to the state the power to enact laws in specified areas, 
notwithstanding the fact that they impair, diminish or repeal the powers of local government demonstrates 
that the state could easily have included similar language in its qualifications for voters. see text, new york 
election law,  5-102.   
60  this interpretation is consistent with art. ix of new yorks constitution, which includes a local government 
bill of rights granting broad powers to local authorities and creating a variety of structural impediments to 
state legislators ability to limit local power.  see, e.g., n.y. const. art. ix,  1(d)(prohibiting annexation of 
territory without referenda in both the annexing and annexed territories); 2(b)(1)(preventing state legislature 
from  repealing,  diminishing,  impairing  or  suspending  any  power  granted  to  local  government  without 
enactment of a statute by the legislature with approval of the governor in that year and the consecutive calendar 
year); 2(b)(2)(preventing state from enacting any law in relation to the property, affairs or government of 
any local government except by general law, or by special law only on request of two-thirds of the total 
membership of its legislative body or on request of its chief executive officer concurred in by a majority of 
such membership).  see also new york statute of local governments,  2, 10, 11, 23.

journal on migration and human securityan elective office, or reduces the salary of an elective officer during his term of office.62  
there  is  a  powerful  argument  that  expanding  the  franchise  for  municipal  elections  to 
include noncitizen residents is a change in method: it would change the very definition of 
who makes up the electorate; it may also require a change in procedures for voting, to make 
sure noncitizens cast the proper ballot.63 where the state legislature sets forth categories 
of local laws subject to mandatory referendum, as it did with  23(2)(e), new york courts 
have said that they will interpret those categories when called upon to do so.64 
the  present  analysis  identified  only  a  few  new york  cases  interpreting  this  provision, 
most of which involved changes [to] the term of elective office clause, but the cases 
interpreted the referendum requirement fairly narrowly.65 thus, it is conceivable that new 
yorks courts would find that this expansion of the franchise is not a change in method. 
for example, the seventeenth amendment to the us constitution providing for popular 
election of us senators (from the prior system of appointment by state legislatures) would 
be a change in method,66 while expanding the franchise to include blacks,67 women68 and 
18 year olds69 might not be. in any event, language in new yorks home rule statute and its 
election laws is ambiguous enough that if intro 410 were passed without referendum, the 
matter would likely trigger a court battle.  
in 2013, intro 410 enjoyed the support of a majority of the new york city council, and at 
least at one point enough to override a mayoral veto.70 a referendum increases the chances 
of defeat.  a similar initiative to extend the franchise in local elections to lawful residents 
was narrowly defeated in portland, maine in 2010 (associated press 2010; hoey 2010).71 
a proposal to allow noncitizen voting in school board elections in san franciscos was 
defeated by a 2.9 percent margin in 2004 (see mello 2004 and kini 2005) and again, in 
2010,  by  a  much  wider  margin  (mejia  2010). at  the  same  time,  a  referendum  in  new 
york city, if it were successful, would dramatically strengthen the legitimacy of intro 410, 
making it much harder to attack in the courts or subvert in the state legislature.

reconceiving citizenship: noncitizen voting in new york cityiv.  lessons to be learned from other experiences
in assessing the feasibility of noncitizen suffrage in new york city, and whether it should 
be adopted by the new york city council or via referendum, what lessons can be learned 
from  other  experiences  with  noncitizen  voting?  this  section  first  briefly  reviews  the 
historical  and  legal  underpinnings  of  noncitizen  suffrage,  which  have  been  thoroughly 
analyzed by legal scholars and political scientists.  it then looks at several successful and 
less successful modern attempts at noncitizen suffrage. the next and final section briefly 
explores the utility of distinguishing de jure obstacles to noncitizen suffrage, where the law 
is an actual impediment, from de facto obstacles, where policy and opinion-makers either 
see the law as an obstacle or where rigid conceptions of citizenship stand in the way of 
extending suffrage to immigrants who have not gone through the naturalization process. 
the analysis then addresses the best way for new york city to move forward on this issue.  
the attempted secession of staten island from new york city in the 1990s illustrates the 
importance of engaging the people of new york city directly in this process, either through 
a city-wide referendum, or, at a minimum, mini-town hall meetings in each of the city 
districts.  

theoretical and historical underpinnings of noncitizen suffrage 

in the united states
in  his  path-breaking  1993  article,  legal  aliens,  local  citizens:  the  historical, 
constitutional and theoretical meanings of noncitizen suffrage, jamin raskin examined 
the historical and legal underpinnings of noncitizen voting in the united states. for  over 
the first 100 years of us history, noncitizen white male property owners were granted the 
franchise in many states and us territories while women, the poor, and blacks remained 
disenfranchised (raskin 1993, 1401).72 while the franchise gradually expanded through 
political struggle and constitutional amendment to incorporate blacks, women, the poor, 
and  even  eighteen  year  olds  (1392-93),  states  began  gradually  to  eliminate noncitizens 
from the electorate, so that, by 1926, all states and the federal government had repealed 
their noncitizen voting laws (raskin 1993, 1397; see also hayduk 2006, 26-27). 
this trend away from noncitizen voting was as much tied to historical events, from the war 
of 1812 to world war i, and growing fears of foreign influence, as it was to the changing 
demographics of immigration beginning in the mid-1800s (raskin 1993, 1398-99, 1403-
04; hayduk 2006, 18, 23, 29). by the post-civil war period, the right to vote gradually 
became  linked  to  questions  of  membership  and  belonging,  with  national  citizenship 
serving as a measure of full belonging,73 but it still took the fifteenth amendment to extend 
the right to vote to blacks,74 the nineteenth amendment to extend it to women,75 and the 
twenty-third amendment to eliminate poll taxes and discrimination on the basis of wealth 

72  see also neuman 1992 on the role of popular sovereignty in defining who the people are and evaluating 
how a revival of alien suffrage would fare under current understandings of democracy.
73  see 39th congress 1st session cong. globe 497-499 (1866)(demonstrating how debate over the fourteenth 
amendment and extending citizenship to the former slaves was intertwined with concerns about extending 
membership rights to immigrants from non-european countries).

journal on migration and human securityand poverty.76 in 1874, the us supreme court ruled unanimously in minor v. happersat77 
that  missouri  had  not  violated  a  womans  equal  protection  rights  under  the  fourteenth 
amendment by denying her suffrage. the court found that suffrage was not one of the 
privileges of citizenship,78 that all the citizens of the states were not invested with the right 
of suffrage79 and also, giving the example of noncitizen suffrage, that citizenship has not 
in all cases been made a condition precedent to the enjoyment of the right of suffrage.80 
well into the twentieth century, states and the federal government denied the franchise to 
those deemed incapable of exercising it intelligently. in fact, many of the arguments used 
today to deny suffrage to noncitizens mirror arguments made against granting it to blacks, 
women and the poor:  they are new to our system of government; they require a period 
of tutelage; they lack the capacity to exercise the right intelligently (see rosberg 1977, 
1092, 1115; harper-ho 2000, 303-304; hayduk 2006, 78-79). as raskin underscores, it 
was generally through political struggle and the amendment process rather than litigation 
that the right to vote was eventually extended to these marginalized groups (raskin 1993, 
1392-93). 
as noted above, congress eventually made it illegal for a noncitizen to vote in any federal 
election,81  but  in  recognizing  the  power  of  states  and  local  communities  to  extend  the 
franchise to noncitizens in state or local matters, it drew no distinction between those here 
legally and those not.82 we tend to think of citizenship largely in terms of the rights and 
privileges of national citizenship.83 the fourteenth amendment, however, did not abolish 
state citizenship when it constitutionalized national citizenship. on the contrary, in stating 
that all persons born or naturalized in the united states were citizens of the united states 
and of the state where they reside, it both guaranteed and reaffirmed state citizenship.84 it 
ensured that former slaves who were now us citizens were also state citizens, overturning 
dred scott,85 but it also recognized state citizenship as distinct from national citizenship.86 
today, although the supreme court treats voting as a basic right of citizenship,87 it also has 
recognized that there are different types of citizenship and that states and local governments 
should be able to extend greater protections to members of their communities, as long as 
federal baselines are met.88

reconceiving citizenship: noncitizen voting in new york cityrecent experiments with noncitizen suffrage in the united states

noncitizen voting in municipal elections

in the early 1990s, takoma park, maryland, a small, progressive city bordering washington, 
dc, served as a laboratory for noncitizen voting as jamin raskin, a takoma park resident 
and a law professor at american universitys washington college of law, researched the 
historical  and  legal  roots  of  noncitizen  suffrage,  published  his  groundbreaking  article, 
and helped lead a successful campaign for its adoption in municipal elections in takoma 
park  (raskin  1993  1460-66;  kraut  2012). the  share  the vote  campaign  encouraged 
takoma  park  residents  to  vote  yes  on  a  nonbinding  referendum  in  november  1991, 
which narrowly passed and was adopted by the city council the following february (ibid.). 
noncitizen voting expanded to other progressive towns in montgomery county, sparked 
similar efforts around the country. 
not surprisingly, the push for noncitizen voting in washington, dc met with stiff resistance 
from  the  federal  government  (hayduk  2006,  171-72).  although  efforts  to  expand  the 
franchise  in  the  district  of  columbia  began  around  the  time  the  referendum  passed  in 
takoma park, it was more than a decade later when a measure was formally introduced in 
the dc council (after dc mayor anthony williams announced his support for noncitizen 
suffrage) to grant lawful permanent residents the right to vote in municipal elections (ibid., 
169,  171). almost  immediately,  conservative  members  of  the  us  congress,  which  has 
ultimate authority over the district, took steps to block the measure, derailing the initiative 
(ibid., 171-72).  
since noncitizen residents of takoma park gained the right to vote in municipal elections, 
attempts to extend the franchise in other localities have not fared as well.  massachusetts 
is a good example. several towns in massachusetts have passed laws or referenda to allow 
for noncitizen suffrage in municipal elections, including cambridge, brookline, amherst, 
and  wayland,  but  the  state  of  massachusetts  has  repeatedly  failed  to  adopt  enabling 
legislation, as required by massachusetts law (see harper-ho 2000, 312-13 and hayduk 
2006, 173-80).89 despite these efforts, in a veritable groundhog day,90 each legislative 
session  assembly  members  from  these  communities  propose  general  legislation  which 
would allow local governments to extend voting rights in municipal elections to noncitizen 
legal residents91 and special legislation that would allow specific towns that already have 
passed local laws to extend the franchise in local elections to legal residents.92 typically, 
89  see also mass. gen. laws, part i, title viii, ch. 51,  1.  
90  this term refers to a phenomenon from the 1993 movie groundhog day (columbia pictures 1993), 
the story of a weatherman who must keep reliving one particular groundhog day until he becomes a better 
person.

journal on migration and human securitythe enabling legislation would amend the election laws to allow noncitizens 18 years or 
over to vote in any municipal election for any local official or on any local matter as long 
as they remain domiciled in the municipality.93 although the proposals generally have not 
required legal residency, they often have required that the noncitizen declare, under penalty 
of perjury, an intent to become a us citizen and to begin that process if eligible.94 the 
proposals frequently also require approval by the legislative body of the municipality and 
by the voters as a ballot question before submission to the state legislature.95  finally, they 
also clarify that the law would not confer the right to vote in any state or federal election.96 
thus far, iterations of this legislation, including the current version, hb 628, have been 
referred to the states elections law committee where they generally have died after being 
sent for a study order.97  
despite the failure of these proposals to become law, they are useful models for analysis. they 
demonstrate that there are different, often competing, often complementary, conceptions 
of local, state and national citizenship.98 by extending suffrage to those termed by hiroshi 
motomura  americans in waiting99 who have been incorporated into the places where 
they reside, these measures would provide voting rights to persons who have demonstrated 
a commitment to their communities and the country, confronting the standard criticism that 
voting should be reserved to persons who choose to become us citizens. where, however, 
state enabling legislation is required, as it is in massachusetts, it may create a significant 
obstacle to noncitizen suffrage in places where the values of more cosmopolitan locales are 
at odds with the insular values of the state as a whole.  
along these lines, portland, maines failed referendum in 2010 warrants attention. maine

98  for an excellent analysis of competing and complementary conceptions of citizenship, see bosniak 2006. 
99 this is a concept coined by hiroshi motomura from his book,  americans in waiting (2005), which has 
been widely embraced by scholars, advocates and policymakers to capture the idea that many immigrants, 
whether they are here legally or not, are on a pathway to citizenship.  for some, especially lawful permanent 
residents, the pathway is fairly straightforward.  motomura argues that lawful permanent residents are indeed 
americans in waiting, and should enjoy the same rights and opportunities as us citizens while on the 
pathway to citizenship.  he goes on to argue in his latest book, immigration outside the law (2014) that 
many undocumented immigrants are also americans in waiting, that many may eventually become lawful 
permanent residents, and that state and local governments should be able to adopt measures to integrate them 
into their communities.

reconceiving citizenship: noncitizen voting in new york citysignificant immigrant populations in a number of cities, including lewiston and portland 
(goodnough  2007,  a16).  portland  now  has  a  distinctly  multicultural,  cosmopolitan 
character (cadge et al. 2009, 17) while lewiston, a former textile town about fifty minutes 
west of portland, is home to a large somali community that began to migrate there in 2001 
(gilbert 2009, 361-64).  
in 2010, the league of young voters launched a drive to extend the franchise in municipal 
elections in portland to noncitizen legal residents (hoey 2010).100 the measure was initially 
voted down 7-5 by portlands charter commission, which is responsible for proposing 
amendments to the city charter (ibid.). john spritz, a member of the commission who voted 
against the measure, said that several commission members felt that the matter should be 
handled by referendum:  the tone of the commission was not that this was a bad thing but 
it felt like something that should come from the people, not the commission (ibid.). 
in  response,  supporters  launched  a  referendum  drive  to  place  the  measure  on  the 
november ballot. by august, the city clerks office certified 4,522 signatures, enough to 
pass the threshold of 4,487 then required to place the measure on the ballot (hoey 2010). 
subsequently, on august 23, the city council held a public hearing, voting unanimously to 
place the measure on the ballot in a procedural vote triggered by the city clerks certification 
(bell 2010). the referendum was narrowly defeated, however, on november 2, 2010, by 
52 to 48 percent (associated press 2010).  
despite portlands reputation as an immigrant-friendly city which has worked to incorporate 
immigrants and refugees from all parts of the world into the social fabric of the community 
(cadge et al. 2009),101 some saw the defeat as reflecting some mainers concerns with the 
reliance of refugees and immigrants on public assistance.102  until 2011, maines welfare 
system had been more generous than the federal system. when the us congress restricted 
immigrants eligibility for public benefits in 1996,103 maines legislature responded in 1997 
by authorizing the state to provide non-emergency health care to aliens residing in maine 
who would be ineligible for federal assistance under the personal responsibility and work 
opportunity reconciliation act of 1996.104 over the last decade, however, public opinion 
has shifted. nearby lewistons experience with a large influx of somali refugees in 2001, 
depicted as overly-reliant on public assistance, became a rallying cry by many to tighten 

100  the ballot measure called for a yes or no vote on an amendment to the portland city charter that any 
other provision in this charter notwithstanding, legal immigrants who are residents of portland and 18 years 
old or older on the date of any municipal election shall be allowed to register to vote and vote in municipal 
elections.  in order to register, a legal immigrant shall provide proof of identify, age and residency, pursuant 
to title 21-a, and legal status according to standards established by the city clerk.  such persons shall not 
have the right to run for and hold an elected municipal office (league of women voters of maine 2010, 4).   
101  according to cadge et al. (2009), the value of diversity is reflected in portlands strategic planning 
documents, and that immigrants and refugees are often referred to in these documents and by organizational 
and city staff as new mainers, a testament to the conscious effort to minimize a negative otherness that often 
comes with an immigrant label (17).

journal on migration and human securitymaines social safety net (bouchard 2002, 2b; nadeau 2005, 122). indeed, in 2011, maine 
passed legislation terminating state-funded non-emergency medical care for noncitizens 
ineligible for federal medicaid benefits.105 since then, the republican governor has sought 
to  eliminate  other  forms  of  state  public  assistance  to  unauthorized  immigrants  (miller 
2013; moretto 2014). 
what explains this shift? mainers consider themselves a self-reliant, hardworking people 
who turn to public benefits as a last resort. while believing in a social safety net, they also 
have tended to draw a distinction between themselves and those from away (goodnough 
2007, a16).  the  fact  that  many  recent  arrivals  are  muslims  from africa  has  triggered 
racist responses and counter-responses in nearby lewiston, climaxing with a hate rally 
in downtown lewiston in january 2003 led by a white supremacist group from ohio and 
a counter-rally by the many & one coalition at bates college in lewiston.106 in 2012, 
lewiston mayor robert macdonald made news again when he told immigrants in a bbc 
interview, [y]ou come and you accept our culture and you leave your culture at the door 
(thistle 2012). most recently, maine governor lepage, who is running for reelection in 
2014, has engaged in legal and political battles with maine attorney general janet mills, 
the maine municipal association, and many municipalities, including portland and bangor, 
in his efforts to prevent municipal governments from using state funds to provide general 
assistance to unauthorized immigrants and asylum seekers (miller 2013; moretto 2014). 
while the city of portland and many community groups have worked hard to incorporate 
immigrants into the social fabric of that community and to celebrate portlands multicultural 
identity  (cadge  et  al.  2009),  more  insular  values  persist.  indeed,  richard  ranaghan,  a 
member of the portland charter commission who opposed noncitizen suffrage, described 
the right to vote as something to be earned and not something to be handed out lightly 
(hoey 2010). the fact that portland has both the largest immigrant population in the state 
and  the  largest  population  requiring  social  services  may  have  helped  derail  portlands 
referendum and triggered the legislative backlash the following year.107 moreover, even 
if the referendum had passed, it would have conflicted with maines election law which 
provides that to vote in any election in a municipality  a person must be a citizen of the 
united states.108 thus, while a successful referendum in portland would have had powerful 
symbolic value, signaling to newcomers (and to the rest of the state) that immigrants are 
considered full members of the portland community, it arguably would have had limited 
legal effect without reform at the state level. this does not appear likely under the current

106  events in lewiston following the arrival of somali muslims are chronicled in my article, citizenship, 
civic virtue and immigrant integration:  the enduring power of community-based norms (gilbert 2009, 
361-67). interestingly, when asked why the initiative failed in portland, zach heiden of the aclu cited 
mainers  concerns  with  immigrants  reliance  on  public  benefits,  and  explained  how  this  dated  back  to 
lewiston officials response to the arrival of the somalis in lewiston  (phone interview, june 23, 2014).

reconceiving citizenship: noncitizen voting in new york cityregime, but could change after the november 2014 elections.109  

noncitizen voting on school boards

this section will close with a brief discussion of successful and unsuccessful efforts to 
extend  voting  rights  to  noncitizens  in  school  board  elections.    before  discussing  more 
recent experiences in chicago and san francisco, it is worth recalling that, although new 
york state was one of the first to abolish noncitizen suffrage (in 1804), new york city 
was one of the first places to restore such rights (hayduk 2006, 18-22, 101-02). in 1968, 
the state legislature extended the right to vote in new york city community school board 
elections to every parent of a child attending a public school in new york city who was a 
citizen of the state, a resident of the city of new york for at least thirty days, and at least 
eighteen years of age.110 new york states education commissioner interpreted the statute 
to permit noncitizen parents of public school students to serve on school boards as well.111   
in 2003, however, mayor bloomberg abolished new york citys 32 community school 
boards, which had been criticized as ineffective, politicized and corrupt, replacing them 
with community education councils (cecs) whose members would be selected by the 
leadership  of  local  parent  associations  (gootman  2004,  b2).112  the  cecs  seemed  an 
elaborate effort to create school councils run by parents, but through a system of special 
purpose elections which virtually guaranteed that only parents with a vote, the selectors, 
would serve in a leadership capacity.113 with outgoing mayor bloomberg criticized for

as stating, the lepage administration remains committed to protecting our scarce resource for the people 
of maine and this country, particularly the elderly and disabled. see also moretto 2014 quoting mayhew 
as stating, if municipalities choose to offer assistance to illegal, undocumented immigrants, they will do so 
without state funding support.

expressly endorsed this policy. id.  
112  the new community educational councils (cecs) consist of 32 12-person councils serving each k-8 
school district, and four city-wide councils, including a high school council and an english language learner 
council.  each of the k-8 councils consists of nine parents selected by the presidents, treasurers and secretaries 
of parent associations at schools within the district or their designees (selectors), two other residents or 
business leaders appointed by the borough president, and one non-voting high school student selected by 
the school superintendent.  membership on the 12-person english language learner council must consist 
of nine parents of english language learners, two individuals with a background in ell appointed by the 
public advocate, and one non-voting high school student receiving ell services. see new york city board 
of education, community education councils at http://www.nycparentleaders.org.

by selectors.  new york city, process for the nomination and selection of members of the community 
education councils, regulation of the chancellor, d-410, part iv (b) (march 24, 2010). those regulations

learner (ell) and at least one had to be the parent of a student with an individualized education plan (iep).

the current selection process.

journal on migration and human securitycentralizing control of the schools and privatizing public education with limited parental 
input (hendrickson 2013), incoming mayor de blasio has promised to dial back or abandon 
many of the changes wrought by his predecessor.114  
we  see  strikingly  similar  developments  in  chicago.    in  1988,  noncitizen  parents  and 
community residents, including those without legal status, were given the right to vote in 
chicago local school council (lsc) elections.115 noncitizen voting was part of a broader 
effort to bring administration of failing schools back to the community by having school 
boards consist mainly of parents and educators116 with the impetus to allow noncitizens 
to participate coming largely from chicagos growing latino community (hayduk 2006, 
104-05). each chicago public school has a lsc which typically consists of 12 members, 
including the principal, six parents, two community representatives, two school employees, 
and a student representative from the high schools (chicago public schools 2014). the 
lsc makes decisions on hiring the school principal, whether to renew his or her contract, 
the school budget, and certain curricular matters (ibid.). 
in 1995, however, the illinois general assembly passed legislation placing control over 
the chicago public schools in the mayors office (task force report 2014). since that 
time, notwithstanding the lscs, chicago parents and teachers have witnessed increased 
centralization in decision-making (ibid.). mayor rahm emmanuel, like mayor bloomberg, 
took  dramatic  steps  to  restructure  the  public  schools,  including  closing  about  50 
underperforming neighborhood public schools, opening charter schools and laying off over 
a thousand school employees (see ahmed-ullah, chase, and secter 2013; perez 2014).  
recently, mayor emmanuels school policies have come under attack. a report from the 
illinois general assemblys chicago educational facilitys task force criticized him for 
school closures, restructuring the school system without public input, and weakening the 
local control exercised by the democratically-elected lscs (task force report 2014, vii).  
karen lewis, president of the chicago teachers union and one of his leading critics, very 
publicly considered running against him in his bid for reelection (korecki 2014; zengerle 
2014). 
despite sparring over the future of chicagos public schools, the basic structure of lscs 
remains intact (chicago public schools 2014). participation by parents has reflected, if not 
exactly mirrored, the demographics of the community, with latino participation higher 
than anywhere else in the country (designs for change 2002). one study indicated that 
where lscs worked to foster noncitizen parents participation in the schools, these parents 
were significantly more likely to be engaged in their childrens education and teachers 
more aware of and responsive to students needs (marschall 2008).

reconceiving citizenship: noncitizen voting in new york cityin school board elections to noncitizen parents is consistent with trends in other jurisdictions. 
the 2004 referendum on proposition f has been thoughtfully covered by others and is not 
reviewed in depth here, except to raise some additional questions relevant to noncitizen 
suffrage in new york city municipal elections (see kini 2005; yang 2006; hayduk 2006, 
110-138). proposition f lost by a narrow 2.9 percent margin.117 various explanations have 
been offered for its defeat: (1) it would have extended voting rights to both legal residents 
and the unauthorized (yang 2006, 77); (2) matt gonzalez, then-president of the board of 
supervisors, ran for mayor on this platform (and lost) in a high-visibility campaign the 
year before and made it no secret that he believed noncitizen voting should be allowed in 
municipal elections as well (ibid., 88); (3) coalition building was from the top-down and 
there was a perceived failure to engage asian-americans (ibid.); (4) the proposal appeared 
on a very crowded ballot in the contentious 2004 presidential elections (ibid., 85); (5) sf-
sos, a nonprofit group funded by some of san franciscos largest businesses, effectively 
used anti-immigrant rhetoric in opposing the initiative, with democratic senator diane 
feinstein emphasizing voting as a core privilege of  citizenship (mello 2004, 78); and (6)
gap retail store owner don fisher, a member of sf-sos, donating $49,000 to sf-sos at 
the last minute (ibid.).  
the  perception  that  proposition  fs  proponents  focused  on  latinos  while  ignoring  the 
asian community is belied by the fact that the campaign was led by david chiu of voice 
for all  parents,  who  was  eventually  elected  to  the  board  of  supervisors  in  2008  and 
became the first asian american to serve as president of the board. chiu also spearheaded 
the referendum in 2010.  nonetheless, there may have been a public perception that this 
was a gonzalez-driven effort that would benefit his latino constituents (yang 2006, 88). 
moreover, some of gonzalezs strategic objectives may have been at odds with those of 
voice for all parents, which attempted to emphasize the incremental nature of the proposal 
and focus on the benefits to be gained by engaging all parents in their childrens education 
(ibid., 81). 
in 2010, david chiu introduced a virtually identical proposal onto the november ballot, 
proposition d (mejia 2010). this time, supporters ran a much more low-key campaign. 
while several government officials supported the proposal privately and before sympathetic 
audiences, many were loath to support it publicly in light of heightened anti-immigrant 
sentiment among the electorate that year (ibid.). on november 2, 2010, the same day as the 
portland, maine referendum, proposition d failed by nearly 10 percent.118  
san  franciscos  experience  is  a  cautionary  tale  for  proponents  of  intro  410. the  2004 
high-visibility  campaign  reportedly  pitted  grassroots  advocacy  groups  against  the 
business community (mello 2004), something that could occur in new york city. major 
beneficiaries in new york city of increased centralization of the public schools have been 
local  contractors,  including,  for  example,  success academy,  the  citys  biggest  charter 
operator, with 22 charter schools.119 this aspect of san franciscos referenda would benefit

the impact of the business community on the electoral process and decision-making at 
city hall.120 yet david chius apparent decision to run a low-visibility referendum the 
second time around, while averting a backlash from the business community, was even 
less successful. in a last-minute campaign letter requesting donations, chiu wrote, many 
voters dont even know prop. d is on the november ballot (mejia 2010). 
notwithstanding these recent experiences, school board elections are arguably the ideal 
setting for extending voting rights to noncitizens. in 1863 the supreme court of vermont 
may have originated the idea that immigrants should be treated as americans in waiting 
when it ruled that noncitizens had the right to vote and serve as school board members. it 
found that vermonts policy was 

to extend to such emigrants all the rights of citizenship, that their feelings and interests 
may become identified with the government and the country. while awaiting the time 
when they are to become entitled to the full rights of citizenship, it seems to us a wise 
policy  in  the  legislature  to  allow  them  to  participate  in  the  affairs  of  these  minor 
municipal corporations, as in some degree a preparatory fitting and training for the 
exercise of the more important and extensive rights and duties of citizens.121 

times and needs in our public schools have changed dramatically, but the same logic still 
applies.  in many cities across the country, children with noncitizen parents make up a 
significant percentage of the public school population. english is often a second language. 
yet ironically, although these students have unique educational needs that will be directly 
impacted  by  school  funding  priorities  and  curricular  decisions,  their  parents  remain 
disenfranchised (yang 2006, 67-68).   
there may be nothing that we as human beings have more in common than a wish to see 
our children succeed.  extending suffrage to noncitizen parents in school board elections 
may be the best way to introduce them to american democracy. it gives them a voice 
in their childrens education; it deepens their ties to their new home, by communicating 
that they  are valued members  of  the community; and  it provides  a  training ground  for 
civic engagement, allowing them to experience the benefits of democratic participation up 
close.122 finally, it encourages them to seek the full responsibilities of us citizenship once 
they are eligible.   
current  battles  over  public  education,  however,  suggest  that  denial  of  voting  rights  to 
noncitizen parents may be symptomatic of a broader tendency. centralized control over 
public schools restricts all but the most engaged parents rights (see hendrickson 2013).  we 
must unpack the causes of the crisis in public education before extension of the franchise to 
noncitizen parents can once again become a reality.

reconceiving citizenship: noncitizen voting in new york cityv.  the way forward
in choosing a course of action, what can new york city learn from these other experiences?  
one possible way to think about the relationship among federal law, state constitutional 
law, state election law, home rule statutes, and local law is to distinguish between de jure 
and de facto obstacles to noncitizen voting.123 in some jurisdictions, such as massachusetts, 
state law is the impediment, while in other places, traditional conceptions of the meaning 
of citizenship and the right to vote may be as great an obstacle as the law itself.  thus it 
is important to be able to distinguish between these two situations, while recognizing that 
societal values about the meaning of citizenship may reinforce de jure obstacles.124 where, 
however,  the  law  only  appears  to  be  an  obstacle,  as  in  the  case  of  new york  election 
law, broad-based campaigns can be effective in educating both government officials and 
members  of  the  public  with  preconceived  understandings  of  the  relationship  between 
voting rights and citizenship.125  
despite extensive hearings in 2013 on intro 410, it did not generate much attention in 
the media or by anti-immigrant groups (see st. albans messenger 2013; de la isla 2013). 
the city council appears to have tabled the measure at the end of the year both because of 
questions regarding its legality and the lack of support from mayor bloombergs office.126 
on june 24, 2014, councilmember dromms legal advisor indicated plans to reintroduce 
the  measure.127 yet  given  the  ambiguities  in  new yorks  election  laws  and  home  rule 
statutes, it is likely that adoption of this measure by the city council will be subject to legal 
challenge. while neither federal law nor state election law appear to be actual obstacles, 
there are strong legal arguments that a mandatory referendum is required.  
in  light  of  recent  experiences  in  other  jurisdictions,  it  is  not  surprising  that  the  new 
york city council is reluctant to hold a referendum. although a successful referendum 
would address the strongest legal argument against a city council measure, it would not 
necessarily avert litigation or legislation. moreover, referendums are, by their very nature, 
unpredictable, as seen in portland and san francisco. even if the vote is close, the 2010 
san francisco referendum on proposition d suggests that second attempts are not feasible. 
a ballot measure in new york city on noncitizen suffrage would probably have to succeed 
on the first try or not at all.   

123  this distinction has frequently been drawn in the context of equal protection analysis as applied to race-
based classifications, particularly in the area of desegregation of public schools.  see, e.g., parents involved 
in community schools v. seattle school district, 551 u.s. 701, 736-737 (2006).  critics have argued that 
this distinction is overly formalistic, and fails to take into account the ways in which ongoing societal or de 
facto discrimination results from past official or de jure discrimination. see parents involved v. seattle school 
district at 820-822 (breyer, j., dissenting).  another area where the court made this distinction but adopted 
a more functional approach involved the claims of indefinite detainees held at guantanamo naval base in 
cuba, where it found that de jure sovereignty was not the touchstone of habeas jurisdiction, and that where 
the united states exercised de facto sovereignty over the naval base, the court had jurisdiction under the 
fifth amendment to consider their claims. boumediene v. bush, 553 u.s. 723, 754-755 (2008).

a  veto-proof  majority,  it  may  choose  for  political  reasons  to  adopt  noncitizen  suffrage 
without a referendum. such a vote would send a powerful symbolic message to noncitizens 
that the citys leaders embrace them as full members of the local community. if the goal 
is to win political points or make a statement, perhaps this is enough. if, however, the 
councils true goal is to incorporate noncitizens into the body politic, it needs to consult 
the current electorate first. noncitizen suffrage adopted after a referendum would provide 
greater democratic legitimacy to a vote by the city council, and it would honor the self-
determination of the people of new york city. possible alternatives to a binding referendum 
might include a non-binding referendum as in takoma park (raskin 1993, 1465), or town 
hall meetings in each of the 51 districts attended by councilmembers, borough presidents, 
panels of experts, and perhaps even the mayor who could listen and respond to community 
members questions and concerns. this would give a city council vote greater political 
legitimacy in the eyes of albany and the current electorate of new york city.  
if a court challenge does occur, a subsequent city-wide referendum could be the remedy. a 
change to state election law, however, would be harder to undo. in massachusetts the state 
legislature has stood as the principal obstacle to noncitizen suffrage. new york city could 
find itself in a similar position.  albany could respond to a city council measure simply by 
amending  5-102 of its election laws to add the words notwithstanding any state or local 
law to the contrary at the beginning of that provision, effectively preempting new york 
city and other local governments from granting voting rights to noncitizens in municipal 
elections. 
so what is the way forward? in 2010, the new york state comptroller reported that in 
2008  immigrants  made  up  36.4  percent  of  the  citys  population  and  43  percent  of  the 
workforce, that immigrants accounted for $215 billion in economic activity, or 32 percent 
of the gross city product, and that between 2000 and 2007, the boroughs with the highest 
concentration of immigrants also had the highest economic growth (dinapoli 2010). the 
state comptrollers report powerfully demonstrated that immigrants in all sectors of the 
economy have been key to new york citys vitality, economic growth and survival, even 
during  hard  economic  times,  and  that  with  their  economic  success  many  have  become 
home owners, revitalizing neighborhoods and deepening their ties to the city (ibid.).128  
in 1898, when new york city was consolidated into five boroughs, it was described as the 
greatest experiment in municipal government the world has ever known (krout 1948, 41). 
new york city is much more than a city; in many ways, it is like a nation-state, along the 
ancient greek model. it is a city of new york state, subject to new york law, but it is also 
a city of the world, subject to federal and even international law. the interplay of global, 
national, state, and local politics must be taken into account in defining the people of 
new york city.  
the apparently unrelated example of staten islands attempted secession from new york 
city in the 1990s underscores why the city council must seriously weigh the value of a 
128  according  to  dinapoli, neighborhoods  such  as  chinatown,  flushing, washington  heights,  coney 
island, elmhurst, and corona all display a vitality fueled by their immigrant residents, many of whom are 
creating businesses and jobs as they seek to meet their communities needs. as their incomes have risen, 
many immigrants have become home owners, further strengthening their ties to the city (2010, 1).

reconceiving citizenship: noncitizen voting in new york cityreferendum in new york city on this issue, or at least some measure to further public 
education and ensure popular input. when staten island attempted secession, one of the 
biggest  criticisms  was  that,  while  it  would  result  in  a  loss  of  one  of  new york  citys 
boroughs, the people of new york city (other than staten islanders) were given no say  
the procedure, which included an initial referendum by the people of staten island, the 
creation  of  a  commission  to  draft  a  city  charter,  another  vote  on  the  charter  by  staten 
islanders, and final approval from the state legislature, gave no voice to people in the other 
four boroughs. (briffault 1992, 777-78). it was also at odds with analogous procedures 
for annexing territory, which required referenda by the people in both the annexing and 
annexed areas.129 the measure was ultimately defeated, but not before it generated deep 
divisions among new yorkers, including the people of new york city who saw themselves 
disenfranchised, and staten islanders who saw their effort at self-rule thwarted at the last 
moment.130   
given the particular contributions that immigrants make to the economic health and vitality 
of new york city, the people of the city are likely to be ready for noncitizen voting long 
before  the  people  of  the  state  are.  new york  city  voters,  however,  need  to  be  part  of 
the process. recent reactions in the media to the new york is home act underscore that 
deep public resistance to extending political rights to noncitizens still exists.131 pushing 
a local measure through the city council without public input is likely to trigger a media 
backlash and could result in lengthy, divisive and unpredictable battles in the courts or, even 
worse, restrictive state legislation.  alternatively, public hearings or town hall meetings on 
noncitizen suffrage in the 51 districts of new york city would add democratic legitimacy 
to  the  process  already  underway,  and  would  allow  the  current  electorate  to  weigh  in. 
they could also serve to educate new yorkers that there are various forms of citizenship, 
that citizenship is ultimately about membership in a community, and that enfranchising 
immigrants where they live, work, run businesses, and send their kids to school, is likely 
to strengthen their commitment to their communities while encouraging them to become 
civic-minded us citizens when that pathway finally opens up.   

conclusion
immigrant integration is ultimately a local matter. an expansion of the franchise in new 
york city municipal elections to include noncitizens who are lawfully present and who have 
resided in the city for the requisite time would be a dramatic step forward in incorporating 
immigrants into local communities and ensuring that their voices are heard.  if the new york 
city council hopes to make more than a political statement on this and avoid triggering 
lengthy, divisive, costly, and unpredictable court battles, it must be prepared, sooner or later, 
to hold a city-wide referendum, which may be necessary as a matter of law. at a minimum, 
before voting on the measure, it needs to engage current voters through town hall meetings 
or  listening  sessions  in  the  51  districts. a  well-orchestrated yes  campaign  in  favor  of 
noncitizen suffrage could lead to the next great experiment in municipal government.
