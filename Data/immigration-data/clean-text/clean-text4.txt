executive summary
naturalization  has  long  been  recognized  as  a  crucial  step  in  the  full 
integration  of  immigrants  into  us  society.  yet  until  now,  sufficient 
information on the naturalization-eligible has not been available that would 
allow  the  federal  government,  states,  localities,  and  non-governmental 
service providers to develop targeted strategies on a local level to assist 
this population to naturalize and to overcome barriers to eligibility. this 
paper  remedies  that  deficiency  by  providing  detailed  estimates  on  the 
naturalization-eligible  from  data  collected  in  the  us  census  bureaus 
american community survey (acs).  
naturalization rates have traditionally been calculated  by dividing the 
naturalized  or  the  naturalization  eligible  populations  by  all  foreign-
born persons; i.e., the naturalized, legal non-citizens, and undocumented 
residents. by including the unauthorized in this calculation, naturalization 
rates have appeared misleadingly low for populations that can naturalize. 
by  contrast,  the  center  for  migration  studies  of  new  york  (cms) 
provides naturalization eligibility rates, which it calculates by dividing 
the  naturalization  eligible  by  the  foreign-born  population,  minus 
undocumented residents and legal residents who arrived after mid-2008. 
the paper reports that 8.6 million us residents were eligible to naturalize 
in  2013.  this  figure  approximates  the  8.8  million  estimate  of  the  us 
department  of  homeland  security  (dhs).  mexican  nationals  constitute 
the  largest  naturalization-eligible  population  at  2.7  million,  followed  by 
indian  (337,000),  chinese  (320,000),  cuban  (316,000),  and  canadian 
(313,000) nationals. fifty countries have 25,000 or more naturalization-
eligible persons. the large number of legally resident mexican nationals 
and  this  populations  high  naturalization  eligibility  rate  mean  that  us

 2015 by the center for migration studies of new york. all rights reserved.jmhs volume 3 number 4 (2015): 306-329states with large mexican populations have relatively high percentages of 
legal foreign-born residents who can naturalize.
the overall naturalization eligibility rate was 31 percent in 2013, including 
48 percent for mexican nationals. nine of the 25 largest us naturalization-
eligible populations by source country have naturalization eligibility rates 
in excess of 40 percent, including mexico (48 percent), canada (45 percent), 
el  salvador  (42  percent),  the  united  kingdom  (41  percent),  guatemala 
(44 percent), japan (56 percent), honduras (48 percent), and brazil (41 
percent). on a state level, california, texas, new york, and florida contain 
roughly five million of the us naturalization-eligible or about 58 percent of 
the total population.
the paper finds that a large number of naturalization-eligible immigrants 
may have difficulty meeting the naturalization requirements or may need 
intensive  support  to  do  so.  this  population  likely  includes  substantial 
percentages of the 2.87 million naturalization-eligible who have lived in 
the united states for more than 25 years; 1.16 million who do not speak 
english; 3.0 million with less than a high school education; and the 1.8 
million  with  incomes  below  the  poverty  level.  on  the  other  hand,  high 
percentages  of  eligible  immigrants  would  seem  to  be  well-situated  to 
naturalize, including those who have lived in the united states for more 
than 10 years (78 percent); are age 35 or older (74 percent); are married (64 
percent); speak english well, very well, or only english (65 percent); have 
access to both a computer and the internet (74 percent); earn income above 
the poverty level (79 percent); and have health insurance (72 percent).

introduction
a recent report on the integration of immigrants into the united states by the national 
academies of sciences, engineering, and medicine begins:

the successful integration of immigrants and their children contributes to economic 
vitality  and  to  a  vibrant  and  ever-changing  culture.  americans  have  offered 
opportunities to immigrants and their children to better themselves and to be fully 
incorporated into us society, and in exchange immigrants have become americans 
  embracing  an  american  identity  and  citizenship,  protecting  the  united  states 
through service in its military, fostering technological innovation, harvesting its crops, 
and enriching everything from the nations cuisine to its universities, music, and art 
(national academies 2015).

despite  the  significance  of  citizenship  to  immigrant  integration,  information  on  the 
naturalization-eligible  has  not  been  sufficiently  detailed  at  the  local  level  to  allow  the 
federal government, states, localities, and non-governmental service providers to develop 
strategies for assisting this population to naturalize and to identify and overcome barriers 
to eligibility. the new geographic and demographic information about the naturalization-
eligible  described  in  this  center  for  migration  studies  of  new  york  (cms)  paper,  in 

307

the us eligible-to-naturalize populationcombination with soon to-be-released cms estimates of the naturalization-eligible on a 
sub-state level, will go far in remedying this deficiency.
two important aspects of the estimates presented in this paper should be noted:

1.  with  minor  exceptions,  the  two  populations  described  here    naturalized  and 
eligible-to-naturalize  exclude those who had resided in the country for less than 
five years.2 this maintains consistency in the data used to compute rates.

2.  the sum of the naturalized and the eligible-to-naturalize population is referred to as 

the legal foreign-born resident population.

nationwide findings from this cms paper include the following:

  a total of 8.6 million us residents were eligible to naturalize in 2013. this figure is 
close to the us department of homeland security (dhs) estimate of 8.8 million.
  mexican nationals constitute the  largest  naturalization-eligible population at  2.7 
million, followed by indian (337,000), chinese (320,000), cuban (316,000), and 
canadian (313,000) nationals.

  fifty countries have 25,000 or more naturalization-eligible persons.
  the overall naturalization eligibility rate  i.e., the number of naturalization-
eligible,  divided  by  the  sum  of  the  naturalized  and  the  naturalization-eligible 
populations  was 31 percent in 2013, including 48 percent for mexican nationals. 
  nine  of  the  25  largest  us  naturalization-eligible  populations  by  source  country 
have naturalization eligibility rates in excess of 40 percent, including mexico (48 
percent), canada (45 percent), el salvador (42 percent), the united kingdom (41 
percent), guatemala (44 percent), japan (56 percent), honduras (48 percent), and 
brazil (41 percent). 

  high percentages of the naturalization-eligible have lived in the united states for 
more than 10 years (78 percent); are age 35 or older (74 percent); are married (64 
percent); speak english well, very well, or only english (65 percent); have access to 
both a computer and the internet (74 percent); earn income above the poverty level 
(79 percent); and have health insurance (72 percent).

  a  substantial  number  of  the  naturalization-eligible  may  have  greater  difficulty 
negotiating  this  process,  including  high  percentages  of  the  2.87  million 
naturalization-eligible persons who have lived in the united states for more than 
25 years; 1.16 million who do not speak english; 3.0 million who have less than a 
high school education; and 1.8 million who have incomes below the poverty level.

at the state-wide level, cms finds that:

  the large size of the mexican legally resident foreign-born population and its high 
naturalization eligibility rate means that us states with large mexican populations 
 like new mexico, texas, and arizona  have relatively high percentages of 
legal foreign-born residents who can naturalize. 

2   as a result, the totals shown will be less than the entire population of these two groups. note, also, that the 
estimates have been adjusted for undercount and that undocumented residents are excluded from the data. for 
more information on the reason for the exclusion of eligible-to-naturalize persons who had resided in the us 
for less than five years, see footnote 3.

308

journal on migration and human security  california, texas, new york, and florida contain roughly five million of the us 

naturalization-eligible or about 58 percent of the total population.

regarding the state figures, we note that for select states cmss figures diverge substantially 
from dhs estimates. the reasons for this divergence are discussed in appendix b.

cms estimation procedure
cms has derived the estimates set forth in this paper from data collected in the us census 
bureaus  american  community  survey  (acs)3  in  2013.  the  estimation  procedure, 
described in more detail in appendix a, relied on the acs questions on country of birth, 
citizenship status, and year of immigration. all of the estimation was done at the micro data 
level. in summary, cms compiled data for non-us citizens who entered before mid-2008,4 
removed  those  that  it  had  previously  identified  as  undocumented  residents,  and  made 
adjustments that took into account specific residency requirements of refugees, spouses of 
us citizens, and active-duty military. it estimates that a total of 8.6 million were potentially 
eligible to naturalize in 2013.
dhs estimated that a total of 8.8 million were eligible to naturalize in 2012, but dhs 
published estimates are limited to the top 20 states, the top 20 countries, and five-year 
periods of entry (rytina 2013). the cms estimates for 2013 are generally consistent with 
the dhs estimates even though the two sets of estimates were derived using different data 
and methods. comparisons between the cms and dhs methodologies and estimates are 
shown in appendix b.  
the paper uses the term potentially to signal that the cms estimates of the naturalization-
eligible include some persons who are not currently eligible to naturalize (e.g., children 
under age 185 and others who do not meet the language and civics requirements), although 
they could become eligible as their circumstances change. the paper refers to this population 
as naturalization-eligible, eligible to naturalize, or simply the eligible.
detailed data exclusively for legal residents have not been available previously because 
undocumented  residents  are  included  in  the  foreign-born  data  collected  in  censuses 
and surveys.6 to derive estimates of the legally resident foreign-born population, cms 
compiled data about the naturalized population from the acs and added it to the estimates 
of the eligible-to-naturalize population described above. the result is a unique set of data 
for contrasting the social and economic characteristics of those who have naturalized with 
those who have yet to naturalize. 

3   the acs is an annual statistical survey conducted by the census bureau. it covers approximately 1 percent 
of the total us population. the survey gathers information previously obtained in the decennial census long 
form. the public-use data from the survey provides detailed social and economic data for all states, as well 
as all cities, counties, metropolitan areas, and population groups of 100,000 people or more.
4    most  of  those  in  the  2013 acs  who  entered  after  mid-2008  would  not  meet  the  five-year  residency 
requirements to naturalize. see appendix a for a detailed description of the methodology.
5   lawful permanent residents (lprs) must be at least 18 years old to apply to naturalize. however, under 
certain conditions, children born outside the united states can derive citizenship from their parents.
6    as  noted  previously,  cms  removed  undocumented  residents  from  the  data  shown  in  this  report,  as 
described in appendix a.

309

the us eligible-to-naturalize populationthe cms estimates should be especially valuable because they provide information for 
these populations in all of the rich geographic and demographic detail collected in the 
acs. for example, the data show that almost 6,000 naturalization-eligible persons from 
the azores live in massachusetts; 6,200 from somalia live in minnesota; 4,100 from tonga 
live in california; and 2,000 from burma live in oklahoma. the estimates also reveal that 
large  concentrations of  the  eligible-to-naturalize live  in  just  a  few  states.  for  example, 
1.19 million naturalization-eligible persons from mexico live in california, 623,000 from 
mexico live in texas, and 248,000 from cuba live in florida. based on the cms estimates, 
the federal government, states, localities, private funders, and immigrant service networks 
will be able to make educated judgments on which naturalization-eligible groups to target 
for naturalization, where they can be found, and what services to prioritize.

overview of the naturalization-eligible
this section offers an overview of the eligible-to-naturalize. it will be supplemented by 
cmss  release  of  additional  detailed  information,  including  sub-state  estimates  of  this 
population. 

state of residence and national origin

by far the largest naturalization-eligible group by source country  2.7 million  are from 
mexico (table 1). the numbers by source country drop sharply thereafter, ranging from 
337,000 to 313,000 for the next four source countries: india, china, cuba, and canada.  
a total of 50 countries have 25,000 or more naturalization-eligible persons, reflecting the 
diverse origins of this population.
table 1 shows estimates by country of origin in two ways: (1) ranked by the total number 
eligible to naturalize (column 2), and ranked by the percent eligible to naturalize (column 
6). the top 25 countries in each category are displayed. nationally, about 31 percent of 
the legally resident population has not naturalized. high percentages in table 1 indicate 
low rates of naturalization. by far the largest number eligible to naturalize are immigrants 
from mexico (2.72 million). almost half (48 percent) of all legal residents from mexico 
are eligible to naturalize.
the percentages of those eligible to naturalize in each state are positively correlated with 
the size of the legal immigrant population from mexico. for example, in new mexico, 
texas, and arizona, states with high percentages from mexico, roughly 40 percent have 
not naturalized; in new york, new jersey, and virginia, states with lower percentages of 
immigrants from mexico, only about 26 to 28 percent have not naturalized (table 2). 
california has the largest number eligible to naturalize, about 2.27 million, slightly more 
than one-fourth of the us total of 8.6 million. three other states  texas, new york, and 
florida  also have sizable numbers (table 2). these four states contain about five million 
eligible to naturalize, or about 58 percent of the total population.

of  origin.  of  the  ten  states  with  the  largest  number  of  naturalization-eligible,  persons 
of  mexican  origin  constitute  the  largest  population  in:  california  (1.19  million), texas 
(623,000),  illinois  (143,000),  arizona  (133,000),  washington  (42,000),  and  georgia 
(37,000). about 248,000 cubans who are eligible to naturalize live in florida, and 131,000 
from the dominican republic live in new york. a total of 14 states have fewer than 25,000 
eligible-to-naturalize, ranging from kentucky (24,600) to wyoming (3,400).

most eligible-to-naturalize immigrants are long-term residents: 78 percent have lived in 
the united states for 10 years or more; 24 percent for 30 years or more; and 10 percent for 
at least 40 years (tables 3 and 4). three-quarters of naturalization-eligible immigrants are 
35 years of age or older, and the majority are married. half of them speak spanish at home, 
but two-thirds speak english well, very well, or only english. forty percent have attended 
college, and three-quarters have access to the internet. seventy-nine percent have incomes 
above the poverty level, and 72 percent have health insurance coverage.
as these figures indicate, most members of this population represent strong candidates for 
naturalization and are integrating well into us society by many traditional metrics. the 
naturalization process could, however, present a greater challenge for a minority of this

the us eligible-to-naturalize populationpopulation. for example, we might ask why 2.9 million, or one-third of the total, have lived 
in the united states for more than 25 years and have not naturalized. also, 1.2 million do 
not speak english; 3.0 million have less than a high school education; and 1.8 million have 
incomes below the poverty level (table 4).
table  4  shows  estimates  of  the  naturalized  and  the  naturalization-eligible  populations 
for 10 demographic variables. the naturalization rate and the median income are shown 
for each variable and for each characteristic within the variables. as might be expected, 
naturalization rates increase with age, length of residence, ability to speak english, and 
educational attainment. those who are above the poverty level and those who have health 
insurance have naturalization rates slightly above average. 
for the naturalized population, there is a strong relationship between income, other standard 
indicia of immigrant integration, and naturalization rates (table 4, columns 3 and 4). for 
example, as the educational level increases from less than high school to bachelors 
degree or higher, median income increases from $12,800 to $48,000, and naturalization 
rates increase from 55 percent to 78 percent.
for the eligible-to-naturalize population, median incomes also increase with age, length 
of residence, ability to speak english, and educational attainment, but the gains are not as 
large or as consistent as for naturalized citizens (table 4). in 2013, the median income of 
the total naturalization-eligible population was $15,000, which was about $9,000, or 38 
percent, lower than the median income of the naturalized population ($24,000). in fact, 
median income for the naturalization-eligible population is substantially lower than that of 
the naturalized population in almost every category shown in table 4, with only the narrow 
sub-group of 18-20 year olds showing as much as an equal median income.
among other sub-groups, persons who reported speaking dravidian languages at home 
provided  interesting  exceptions  to  several  general  findings.8  for  example,  although 
naturalized  citizens  who  reported  speaking  a  dravidian  language  at  home  had  median 
incomes ($56,900) that were more than twice the median income of the total naturalized 
population ($24,000), their naturalization rate was below average. in addition, naturalization-
eligible dravidian speakers had median incomes almost as high ($55,000) as naturalized 
dravidian speakers.

8   dravidian languages are spoken mainly in southern india.

journal on migration and human securityconclusion
the data set forth in this paper reveal two striking patterns. first, for naturalized citizens, 
median income and naturalization rates rise as age, length of residence, ability to speak 
english, and educational attainment increase. second, in every category but one, those 
who have not yet naturalized have lower median incomes than those who have naturalized. 
it is not possible to demonstrate causal relationships with this data. for example, does 
naturalization increase income, or are those with higher incomes more likely to naturalize? 
however, it appears that there are financial benefits for learning to speak english well and 
increasing educational levels. 
this paper raises several policy issues. first, the description of the naturalization-eligible 
population  reveals  that  the  characteristics  and  capabilities  of  the  population  are  not 
homogeneous. the majority of the eligible-to-naturalize are likely in a good position to 
naturalize, but there are millions who would find it difficult to meet the language and other 
requirements for naturalization. this dichotomy raises a number of questions regarding 
how to allocate limited federal, state, local and community-based naturalization resources 
most  effectively.  should  we  rely,  for  example,  on  publicity  and  outreach  to  encourage 
those who are well-situated to naturalize to take this step, while devoting more substantial 
resources for english language and other assistance to the second group? or would it be 
more effective to devote the lions  share of  resources  to  naturalization-eligible persons 
who  will not experience substantial difficulty in the naturalization process? these data 
will be an indispensable tool for making these kinds of judgments, identifying necessary 
interventions and facilitating assistance to both groups.
the denominator used to calculate the naturalization eligibility rates set forth in this 
paper  the foreign-born population, excluding undocumented residents and excluding 
legal residents who arrived after mid-2008  provides an opportunity to reexamine the 
utility of traditional naturalization rates. in fact, the paper opts to provide naturalization 
eligibility  rates,  rather  than  naturalization  rates.  naturalization  rates  have  traditionally 
been calculated by using, as the denominator, all foreign-born persons (the naturalized, 
legal non-citizens, and undocumented residents). by including the unauthorized in this 
calculation, naturalization rates have appeared misleadingly low for the populations that 
can be naturalized. the data in table 1 for mexico can be used, along with an estimate of 
undocumented residents from mexico, to illustrate this point. the data for mexico show 
that  48  percent  are  eligible  to  naturalize.  in  contrast,  the  traditional  naturalization  rate 
for mexico would be just 27 percent because 5.4 million (warren 2014) undocumented 
residents would have been included in calculating that rate. the naturalization eligibility 
rate for mexico, computed using the data presented here, is relatively high compared to 
other countries, meaning that a relatively higher rate of legally resident mexican nationals 
are eligible to naturalize and a relatively lower rate have, in fact, naturalized. because 
naturalization eligibility rates reflect the foreign-born population that could naturalize in 
the short term (prior to legislation to legalize the us undocumented population), this rate 
should be more useful in targeting outreach and services to the naturalization-eligible. 
a second policy issue relates to those who have lived the longest in the united states. 
providing an easier path to naturalization would be an appropriate response to persons with 
decades of lawful and productive us residence. under us law, persons age 50 or older who 

317

the us eligible-to-naturalize populationhave been lawful permanent residents (lprs) for 20 years or those age 55 or older with 
15 years in lpr status are exempt from the english-language requirement to naturalize, 
although not from the civics test. it would make sense to expand these exceptions, and to 
supplement them with an alternative (minimum) set of requirements for the naturalization 
of very long-term lprs, akin to the registry9 provisions that allow undocumented residents 
who have resided here since 1972 to adjust to legal resident status (warren and kerwin 
2015, 99-100). for example, a streamlined and expedited naturalization system for persons 
who  have  had  lpr  status  for  at  least  35  years  would  have  covered  nearly  1.2  million 
persons in 2013, according to cms estimates, and would cover approximately 100,000 
each year thereafter.
third, the cms estimates reveal that three million naturalization-eligible persons do not 
speak english or speak only a little english. thus, they argue for substantial investments 
in  english-language  instruction.  they  also  illustrate  the  need  to  prioritize  immigrant 
integration more broadly, given the strong correlation between naturalization and income, 
poverty status, english-language proficiency, and health insurance coverage. moreover, 
the  cms  data  argue  for  reduced  naturalization  fees  and  generous  fee  waiver  policies. 
they  indicate  that  the  median  annual  income  of  the  naturalization-eligible  population 
nationwide is $15,000, with lower levels of median income among persons who speak 
spanish ($13,000), korean ($11,200), or arabic ($6,300) at home, and those without a high 
school education ($10,200). naturalization filing fees of $680 ($595 for the application and 
$85 for biometric screening) constitute a high percentage of the annual income of many 
naturalization-eligible persons and could certainly present a disincentive to naturalization 
in these cases.  
the purpose of this paper is to introduce a new set of detailed data for those potentially 
eligible to naturalize. cms undertook the project out of the conviction that making social 
and economic data for this population available down to the puma10 level would help to 
focus resources where they are most needed, and would lead to improved naturalization 
policies and sustained increases in naturalization rates. the project seeks to democratize 
data on this population in order to allow the federal government, states, localities, and 
non-governmental  agencies  to  develop  strategies  for  identifying  naturalization-eligible 
populations  by geographic area, source country, and a variety of demographic criteria  
and to encourage and assist targeted populations to naturalize. in the spirit of the national 
academies report, we hope to enhance the opportunities of immigrants and their children 
to embrace an american identity and citizenship. 

9   under the registry provision, undocumented residents can adjust to lpr status if they entered before 1972; 
lived in the united states continuously since then; are persons of good moral character; are not ineligible 
for naturalization; and are not deportable under various sections of the immigration and nationality act.
10   public use microdata areas (pumas) are census-defined areas that have approximately 100,000 total 
population.

appendix  a.  estimation  of  the  number  eligible  to 
naturalize
step 1. the first step in the estimation procedure was to compile data from the 2013 acs 
for all noncitizens who entered the united states from 1920 to 2013. note that most who 
entered in 2009 or later are not included in these estimates because they would not meet 
the five-year lpr residency requirement. however, some who entered in 2008, as well as 
some who entered later, would be eligible to naturalize, and they were taken into account, 
as described in subsequent steps.
step 2. next, we removed undocumented residents that cms estimated were included in the 
acs data. in deriving those estimates it was assumed that nearly all of the undocumented 
resident population is contained in the acs data for noncitizens that entered the united 
states after 1981. very few who entered before 1982 would still be residing in the united 
states as undocumented residents in 2013 because: (1) a large percentage of those who 
entered before 1982 obtained legal status under the immigration reform and control act 
of 1986 (irca);11 and (2) the remainder have had more than 30 years in which to leave 

11   the immigration reform and control act of 1986 (irca) went into effect in 1987. under irca, the 
two main groups who were eligible for legalization were: legalization applicants who continuously resided 
in the united states since before january 1, 1982 and special agricultural workers (saws) who had 60 days 
of seasonal agricultural work experience in qualifying crops from may 1985 to may 1986. about 1.6 million 
legalization applicants and 1.1 million saw applicants were approved.

323

the us eligible-to-naturalize populationthe undocumented resident population  that is, to secure legal status, be removed, leave 
voluntarily, or die. 
the  methodology  used  to  identify  undocumented  residents  involved  three  major  steps: 
(1) applying a series of edits, referred to as logical edits,12 to identify and remove as 
many legal residents as possible based on responses in the survey; (2) deriving separate 
population  controls,  for  145  countries  or  areas,  for  undocumented  residents  counted  in 
the acs; and (3) using those population controls to make final selections of individual 
respondents in the acs to be classified as undocumented residents (warren 2014, 308). 
the result of these procedures was a flag for each undocumented resident.13 we used this 
information to remove undocumented residents from the 2013 acs data for noncitizens.
step 3. in most cases, five years of lpr status is required to naturalize, but the acs asks 
only: where did you live 1 year ago?  cms used the response to that question to exclude 
people who had breaks in residence. in particular, it subtracted noncitizens that entered 
before 2008 and reported that they lived abroad one year ago.
step 4. to take account of the shorter length of residency requirement for refugees, cms 
included all noncitizens who entered the united states in 2008 from the following countries: 
bhutan, burma, burundi, central african republic, democratic republic of the congo, 
iraq, nepal, and somalia.
step 5. three years of marriage to a us citizen is required to qualify for naturalization, but 
the acs asks only whether a marriage occurred one year ago. cms added noncitizens that 
entered in 2008 or 2009 and were married to us citizens, except those who reported that 
their marriage occurred one year ago. 
step 6.  cms added noncitizens who were on active military duty and who entered the 
united states after 2007.
step 7. adjustment of the 2008 entry cohort. after completing step 6, we removed half of 
those who entered the united states in 2008. the table on the following page illustrates the 
reason for this adjustment.

12   the term logical edit refers to the process of determining probable legal status by examining survey 
data. cms assigned respondents to the legal category if they worked in occupations that generally require 
legal status, were legal temporary migrants, were immediate relatives of us citizens, received public benefits, 
were from countries where most arrivals would be refugees, or were age 60 or older at entry.
13   detailed information about undocumented residents, including social and demographic characteristics, 
for all states and for all pumas is available at: http://data.cmsny.org/

because of the survey design, the acs data for the foreign-born population that entered 
in the year the survey is conducted amounts to only a half-year of data, as shown above 
for 2013. to derive estimates of those eligible to naturalize, we needed to exclude those 
who had resided in the united states for less than five years. to do so, it was necessary to 
exclude half of those who entered in 2008, as shown in the table above. because month of 
entry is not collected in the acs, we randomly selected half of the 2008 entry cohort for 
each country of origin.
after completing step 7, cms had estimated the number counted in the 2013 acs. the 
final step was to adjust those estimates for undercount.
step 8.  adjustment for undercount. the most recent entrants were assumed to have the 
highest undercount rates (about 8 percent for 2003-2008 entrants), and the undercount rate 
dropped steadily with length of residence, falling to 2 percent for those who entered in the 
early 1980s. the estimated undercount rate for the total population eligible to naturalize is 
about 4.5 percent.

appendix b. comparison of cms and dhs estimates
as described in appendix a, the cms estimates were derived from data collected in the 
acs. as such, they are subject to sampling variability as well as non-sampling errors, 
such as possible errors in the assignment of legal status of noncitizens. the estimates for 
smaller geographic areas should be used with caution. even with those caveats, however, 
the cms estimates should accurately reflect the population eligible to naturalize because 
of the very large sample size of the acs and because the estimates do not require the use 
of the administrative data or assumptions described below.  
the  dhs  estimates  for  2012  were  derived  from  administrative  data  on  the  number 
admitted as immigrants (lprs) from 1980 to 2011; they were reduced by dhs estimates 
of emigration and mortality from entry to 2012. finally, noncitizens who entered before 
1980 were added based on data from the 2012 acs.

325

the us eligible-to-naturalize populationthe data underlying the dhs estimates are subject to two types of potentially significant 
errors: a lack of data on internal migration of lprs; and the absence of separate emigration 
rates by year of entry and for each country of origin.

 internal migration of lprs. the state of residence of lprs is not updated
between entry and 2012. that is, those who were admitted for permanent residence 
in 1980 and lived in california are still estimated to be residing in california in 
2012. for the state-by-state estimates, the potential error in 2012 is the cumulative 
net migration between every state for every year of entry up to 2012. this lack of 
data does not affect the estimated total population eligible to naturalize; however, 
it introduces considerable uncertainty into the dhs estimates for every state.
 emigration of lprs. in the dhs methodology, it is necessary to take account of
emigration (from the united states) of lprs from the year they enter to 2012. the 
similarity of the cms and dhs estimates of the total number eligible to naturalize 
 8.6 million and 8.8 million, respectively  provides support for dhs overall 
level of emigration. however, a potential problem arises because dhs assumes 
that a single rate of emigration applied equally to every country and in every time 
period. 14 the lack of variability in the emigration rates reduces the accuracy of the 
dhs estimates by country of origin.

the  estimates  derived  by  cms  are  not  affected  by  the  lack  of  information  on  internal 
migration or emigration of lprs because the cms estimates are based on the population 
counted in 2013. that is, all internal migrating and emigrating of the population would 
have occurred before they were counted in 2013. thus, both of these components of change 
are automatically taken into account in the cms estimates. 
for the reasons described above, we would expect to observe differences between the cms 
and dhs estimates. tables b-1 and b-2 show comparisons of the cms and dhs estimates. 
dhs top 20 states of residence and top 20 countries of origin are shown in the tables, but 
the states and countries are ranked based on the cms estimates.

14    this  discussion  should  not  be  taken  as  a  criticism  of  dhs  methods,  data,  or  assumptions.  dhss 
assumptions were necessary if any estimates were to be made. instead, this is a reflection of the drawbacks 
of using administrative data for these kinds of estimates, and it is the reason that survey data are being used 
increasingly for these difficult-to-estimate populations.

source: column 1, center for migration studies; see text; column 2, rytina (2013), table 4.
as  tables  b-1  and  b-2  show,  the  cms  and  dhs  estimation  procedures  arrived  at 
approximately the same total population. however, as noted, the lack of internal migration 
data, as well as the assumption of uniform emigration rates, in the dhs data likely reduces 
the comparability of the estimates by state of residence and country of origin.
