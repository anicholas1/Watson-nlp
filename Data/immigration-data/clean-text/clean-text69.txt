 executive summary

the immigration and refugee board of canada (irb) is canadas largest 
administrative tribunal. the refugee protection division (rpd) of the irb 
is responsible for the adjudication of refugee claims made in canada.  in 
accordance  with  its  obligations  under  international  law,  canada  grants 
protection to persons who have a well-founded fear of persecution because of 
race, nationality, religion, political opinion, or membership in a particular 
social group. in addition, a person may request protection in canada on the 
basis of his or her fear of torture, risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual 
treatment  or  punishment.  acceptance  (approval)  rates  of  claims  vary 
widely across members of the irb, with some granting asylum in less than 
10 percent of cases, and others granting asylum in more than 90 percent 
of cases. despite this fact, there is a lack of analysis exploring whether 
grant rates vary systematically in relationship to observed characteristics 
of  adjudicators.  this  paper  presents  statistical  analysis  of  over  68,000 
refugee claims adjudicated by 264 members of the board from 2006 to 2011. 
it  finds  that  the  probability  of  acceptance  is  associated  with  individual 
members  characteristics  including  education,  gender,  and  professional 
experience, when holding constant the claimants country of origin, gender, 
and the year and regional office of adjudication. the findings suggest that 
the identity of the adjudicator affects whether or not an individual receives 
asylum.

in 1969 canada ratified the united nations convention relating to the status of refugees 
and its protocol. to meet its important obligations under international law, canada must 
provide  protection  to  persons  who  have  a  well-founded  fear  of  persecution  because  of 
race, nationality, religion, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. 
in addition, a person may request protection in canada on the basis of his or her fear of 
torture, risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. 
since 1989, refugee protection claimants have had the right to a hearing before the refugee 
protection division (rpd) of the immigration and refugee board of canada (irb). in 
recent years, the irb has come under scrutiny for wide variation in asylum grant rates 
among individual board members. some board members grant status in nearly all claims 
that they adjudicate, while others almost never grant status (rehaag 2008; schmitz 2011; 
sheppard 2012a). in an explanatory note published in 2008, the irb states that disparities 
in board member grant rates are attributable to the diversity of cases with which each board 
member is confronted.2 
this paper investigates whether the gender, ethnicity, education and prior work experience 
of  adjudicators  influence  the  probability  that  a  refugee  claim  is  successful  in  canada. 
to  address  this  question,  data  on  board  member  characteristics  was  compiled  from 
government  press  releases  and  linked  to  administrative  records  of  over  68,000  refugee 
claims adjudicated from 2006 to 2011 which were made publicly available through access 
to information requests. 
the analysis concludes that, holding constant all available information about the claim 
(claimants  gender,  country  of  origin,  and  the  year  and  office  in  which  the  claim  was 
adjudicated), the probability that a claim is accepted (approved) is correlated with the board 
members characteristics. otherwise stated, acceptance or denial of claims is partially a 
function of factors that are unrelated to the claim itself. 

canadas refugee status determination system 
this  section  provides  background  on  the  canadian  refugee  determination  system  as 
it  operated  between  2006  and  2011.  the  current  system  (from  2012  onward)  differs 
substantially due to reforms passed in 2010 and 2012. 
there are two principal routes to accessing refugee protection in canada: the selection 
of refugees abroad and the determination of refugee claims made from within canada, 
also  referred  to  as  inland  claims  (becklumb  2008).  overseas  refugees  are  selected  for 
admission to canada as permanent residents on humanitarian grounds and sponsored for 
resettlement  by  the  government  or  non-governmental  agencies.  the  immigration  and 
refugee  protection  act  provides  for  the  protection  of  inland  claimants  who  establish 
that they are either convention refugees or persons in need of protection, defined as

adjudicator bias and decisions of the irb canada (2006-2011)individuals  whose  removal  to  their  country  of  origin  would  subject  them  to  danger  of 
torture, cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or risk to life.3 this paper is concerned 
with  inland  refugee  claims  and  decisions  rendered  by  the  refugee  protection  division 
(rpd) of the irb. 
the irb is canadas largest administrative tribunal, rendering decisions in over 40,000 
refugee and immigration matters each year (public service commission of canada 2009). 
refugee  claims  are  heard  by  the  rpd,  which  has  offices  in  five  major  cities: toronto, 
montreal, ottawa, vancouver, and calgary. in addition, the montreal office sends board 
members to halifax, nova scotia roughly biannually to hear claims in the maritime region. 
each claim is adjudicated by one board member. 
irb members are appointed by the governor in council based on the recommendation 
of the minister of citizenship and immigration canada (public service commission of 
canada 2009, ii). board members in the study sample were administered written tests, 
screened  and  interviewed  by  irb  officials,  external  experts  and  panels  representative 
of  canadians,  before  being  recommended  by  the  minister  for  appointment  (public 
appointments commission secretariat 2007). 
a claim for refugee protection can be made either at a port of entry or at an office of 
citizenship and immigration canada. if a claimant is found eligible by an immigration 
officer to make a claim for protection, the claim is referred to the irb for determination 
and the claimant is issued an order of conditional removal which takes effect if the claim 
is rejected. there are both principal and derivative claims to persecution. for example, if 
a woman fears persecution based on her activities as a member of a political opposition 
group and her husband alleges persecution based on his wifes activities, then hers is the 
principal claim and his is the derivative claim, and both claims are adjudicated in the same 
hearing. a derivative claim can only be well-founded if the principal claim is determined to 
be well-founded.4 at a refugee determination hearing, a claimant is entitled to a designated 
representative. this representative does not have to be a lawyer.
once a board member hears a case, he or she can accept the claim upon the conclusion 
of the hearing or in a written decision mailed to the claimant at a later date. in the case 
of a positive decision, no written reasons are required from the board member. negative 
decisions are always sent by mail, and must be accompanied by written explanation.
a fast-track expedited process is used to decide on claims of certain types or countries of 
origin (becklumb 2008).  in this process, a claimant is interviewed by a refugee protection 
officer  who  makes  a  recommendation  about  the  claim  to  a  board  member.  the  board 
member then decides whether to accept a claim with or without a full hearing. because the 
expedited process is not solely at the discretion of the board member and results in different 
outcomes (if the recommendation is not favorable, then a full hearing is held and there is 
no immediate negative decision), these cases are excluded from this study.
the immigration and refugee protection act provides for the creation of a refugee appeal

2012 through provisions of the balanced refugee reform act and the protecting canadas 
immigration  system  act.5  prior  to  implementation,  failed  claimants  could  petition  the 
federal  court  of appeal  for  judicial  review  of  the  rpds  decision  (becklumb  2008).6 
applications for judicial review comprised a large portion of the total applications to the 
court of appeal (5,298 out of 9,386 cases in 2010). however, in practice leave was rarely 
granted. in 2010, only 14 percent of applications were granted leave to appeal (schmitz 
2011).7 the absence of any other venue for appeal beyond federal court review means that 
refugee hearings are essentially binding.  

research  on  asylum  outcomes  and  judicial  decision 
making 
this paper contributes to a growing body of empirical research on the outcome of asylum 
applications.  in  the  us  context,  a  2006  analysis  of  297,240  asylum  cases  (spanning 
fiscal years 1994-2005) by the transactional records access clearinghouse at syracuse 
university found large variation in the decision making of immigration judges, similar 
to  that  observed  across  irb  adjudicators. the  study  reported  that  denial  rates  for  the 
208 judges ranged from a low of 10 percent to a high of 98 percent (trac 2006). the 
inclusion of immigration judge characteristics in analyses of decision making was part of a 
seminal 2007 study entitled, refugee roulette: disparities in asylum adjudication. the 
study examined 140,428 asylum cases adjudicated between january 1, 2000 and august 31, 
2004 using logit specifications to test for the impact of immigration judge characteristics on 
the probability of refugee claim success (ramji-nogales, schoenholtz, and schrag 2007). 
regression controls include the judges age, gender, previous employment, caseload and 
cases per court, years on the bench, and the president whose attorney general appointed 
the judge (396). in addition, regressions control for the number of dependents a refugee 
claimant had in the united states, the national freedom ranking for the asylum seekers 
country of origin, and the average weekly earnings in the immigration courts state. the 
analysis found significant positive effects on grant probability if the judge had previous 
experience  in  a  non-governmental  organization  or  was  female  and  significant  negative 
effects if the judge had previously worked for the immigration and naturalization service 
(ins) and other governmental departments.8 
in canada, media attention has focused on the wide disparities between individual board 
member grant rates, which were highlighted by the release of 2011 claims data by the 
irb (sheppard 2012b). patterns in canadian refugee adjudication were addressed by sean

irb, see: http://www.irb-cisr.gc.ca/eng/refapp/pages/radsarc31impact.aspx.
6  in accordance with the federal courts act, the grounds for judicial review of decision of the rpd include: 
the body acted without, beyond or refused to exercise its jurisdiction; failed to observe a principle of natural 
justice or procedural fairness; erred in law in making its decision; based its decision on an erroneous finding 
or fact; acted fraudulently or in any other way contrary to law (becklumb 2008).
7  note that this percentage only represents the number of cases granted leave to appeal, not the percentage 
of cases which are successfully appealed.

adjudicator bias and decisions of the irb canada (2006-2011)rehaags study of rpd decisions from 2006 which found that, while patterns in case 
assignment do affect grant rates, they do not account for the full variations evident in the 
data.  rather,  outcomes  in  refugee  adjudication  appear  to  hinge,  at  least  in  part,  on  the 
identity of the adjudicator assigned (rehaag 2008, 335). to reach this conclusion, rehaag 
separated positive decisions from expedited positive decisions and focused on the board 
members who had adjudicated the greatest number of cases from certain countries. the 
analysis shows that individual board members deviate from the overall average grant rates 
by large margins and deviations vary even among board members who are adjudicating 
cases from the same country. for example, of the five board members who adjudicated 
the greatest number of cases from china in 2006, one board member had a grant rate 27 
percent above the board average while another had a grant rate 24 percent below (rehaag 
2008). in a subsequent study, rehaag (2011) investigated the role of gender in hearings 
conducted from 2004 to 2008 and found that the grant rate of female board members was 
lower. the major limitation of this work is that no controls are added to account for the fact 
that male and female board members may differ along other dimensions such as education 
level or prior work experience. thus, the results could be driven by these omitted variables. 
this paper furthers the analysis of the boards decisions by using a larger, multi-year sample 
and more sophisticated empirical techniques. the methodology allows the present analysis 
to hold more case characteristics constant, examine the entire board for whom data was 
available (not just the adjudicators hearing the most cases), and consider individual factors 
that might influence the decision-making of adjudicators. the present analysis performs 
regressions  that  include  gender  both  individually  and  along  with  other  board  member 
characteristics. in addition, it uses a richer set of controls. rather than country-year grant 
rates, this paper uses binary variables for country of origin and year of adjudication as 
well as office of adjudication and claimant gender. rehaag concludes that, in canada, 
male  adjudicators  were  6  percent  more  likely  to  grant  refugee  status  than  their  female 
counterparts (rehaag 2011, 648). in fact, the present analysis shows that with a more 
robust set of controls, the impact of gender is actually the opposite. a case has a higher 
probability of success if the adjudicator is female.
the  analysis  of  refugee  status  determinations  is  also  related  to  a  broader  literature  on 
judicial decision-making. variation in the leniency of decision-makers has been used as 
an instrumental variable in studies that seek to estimate the causal effects of interventions 
such as criminal sentences (aizer and doyle 2011) and foster care placement (doyle 2007) 
on  long-term  outcomes.  several  studies  also  investigate  the  effect  of  individual  judge 
characteristics on case outcomes. shayo and zussman (2011) analyzed decisions in israeli 
small claims courts from 2000 to 2004 and found that a claim is 17 to 20 percent more 
likely to be accepted if the judge is of the same ethnicity as the plaintiff, representing a 
difference in award of $200 per case. in addition, they found that in the wake of a terrorist 
attack, both arab and jewish judges favor plaintiffs of their own ethnicity. similarly, in the 
context of bail decisions in israeli courts where judges are randomly assigned to defendants, 
gazal-ayal and sulitzeanu-kenan found systematic evidence of ethnic in-group bias in 
the decision to detain or release on bail (gazal-ayal and sulitzeanu-kenan 2010, 404), 
though the methodology does not allow them to determine whether this is the result of 
preferential  treatment  due  to  shared  ethnicity  or  punitive  treatment  of  outsiders.  in  us 
federal court cases, kulik, perry and pepper surveyed 143 judges adjudicating allegations 

126

journal on migration and human securityof  sexual  harassment,  and  found  that  after  controlling  for  several  case  characteristics, 
plaintiffs were more likely to win their cases if the judge was younger or if he had been 
appointed by a democratic president (2003, 79). an advantage of these studies is that 
assignment of cases to judges was random, and therefore disparities in grant rates should 
not be attributable to case characteristics, since each case has an equal chance of being 
assigned to a given judge. the issue of random versus non-random assignment of cases to 
adjudicators will be addressed in the discussion of this papers methodology below. 

data 
administrative data on refugee hearing outcomes from 2006 to 2011 was obtained by sean 
rehaag through access to information requests and is available on the website of the 
canadian  council  for  refugees  (http://ccrweb.ca). available  variables  vary  slightly  by 
year but include a unique entry for each individual case with a file number, the decision 
rendered, the date the decision was mailed, the claimants country of origin and gender, and 
the name of the board member who adjudicated the case. for the years 2006 to 2010, the 
data contain only the principal refugee claims, while the 2011 data contain both principal 
and derivative claims. for 2009, 2010, and 2011, data on whether or not the case was 
represented by counsel is also available. all of these variables are utilized in the analysis.
according to the raw data released, there were 83,125 principal refugee claims filed with the 
irb from 2006 to 2011, a subset of which is used in the analysis. the primary restrictions 
on the data were the exclusion of claims without a board member identified (n=7,003) and 
the exclusion of cases resulting in an outcome other than a positive or negative decision 
(n=14,322).9 the cleaned dataset has 68,808 principal refugee claims made by claimants 
from 189 countries and adjudicated by 264 board members. table 1 shows the number of 
claims and the grant rate by office and year, and tables 2 and 3 show the top 25 countries 
represented in the sample across all years by number of cases and grant rate, respectively. 
qualitative information about board members was obtained from online press releases 
that were issued at the time of their appointment and/or reappointment. the majority of 
the information came from the website of citizenship and immigration canada (http://
www.cic.gc.ca). older releases were obtained using archived copies of the website 
retrieved from the internet archive. data was not available for all board members. of 
the 264 board members in the entire sample, at least partial data was available for 230 of 
them. the board members with missing information adjudicated a total of 3,439 cases, or 
5 percent of the sample. the approval rate for cases heard by board members for whom 
data was not available was 57 percent compared to 46 percent for the entire sample. this 
higher grant rate is probably due in part to the fact that the average number of cases heard 
by a board member with missing data was much lower than the average number heard by 
the board members for whom data was available between 2006 and 2011: 101 compared 
to 284. 

9  this includes mainly fast-track expedited claims, claims that were abandoned or discontinued, and claims 
that were withdrawn.

canada and the united states; and date of appointment to the board. 
for a minority of board members, the appointment date was explicitly specified in the 
press release. in all other cases, the date of the press release was taken as the appointment 
date. this was used to calculate a variable equal to the time elapsed between the board 
members first appointment and the date each individual case was mailed. examples of 
each board members characteristics are provided in table 4. table 5 shows the number 
and percent of board members in each office who have these characteristics, and table 6 
shows the number and percent of cases in each office adjudicated by a board member with 
each characteristic. 

limitations 
a major threat to the identification strategy of this study is the possibility that refugee 
claims are not randomly assigned to board members and that unseen case characteristics 
could therefore be driving the results. for example, if all refugee cases dealing with the 
persecution of christians were assigned to male board members, and having a male board 
member was found to negatively impact the probability that a refugee claim is accepted, 
the correlation could be due to the board member gender (which is observed in the data) or 
it could be because these specific types of cases are less likely to be accepted and they all 
get assigned to board members of this gender (which is unobserved in the data). 
it is unclear whether case assignment by the irb is random. one board statement claims that 
members are often grouped into specialized geographical teams so that they can develop 
expertise in specific country conditions (quoted in rehaag 2008, 343). to ascertain if 
selective case assignment might confound this analysis, a chi-squared test was performed 
to test the association between the board member identity and the number of cases heard 
from  each  of  the  five  countries  with  the  most  claims  adjudicated  in toronto,  which  is 
the irbs largest regional office. the five countries, china, mexico, colombia, haiti, and 
nigeria, account for 42 percent of all toronto claims in the sample. 
the results indicate that these cases are not assigned to board members based on country of 
origin. the five p-values produced by these tests are all statistically insignificant, ranging 
from 0.329 to 0.391. this is not definitive proof that case assignment by the irb is truly 
random, but it is evidence that counters the irb statement suggesting otherwise. if the 
irb is assigning cases non-randomly based on country, it does not appear to be doing so 
with the most common countries in the sample at its largest office. this finding mitigates 
concerns that associations found between board member characteristics and the probability 
of claim success are being driven by an unobserved factor. in addition, all regressions in the 
study control for a claims country of origin.

notes: panel a shows the number of board members from each office with the characteristic indicated in 
the first column. panel b gives the total number of board members from each office in the sample. note 
that board member characteristics are not mutually exclusive, so numbers in the characteristic breakdown 
may not sum to the total. for example, a board member in the toronto office who is male, holds a law 
degree, and was educated outside of canada or the united states, would be counted in three rows. in 
addition, the numbers in the five offices may not sum to the national total because of incomplete data: 
in some instances the board members characteristic was available (i.e. gender) but his or her office of 
appointment was not.

notes: panel a shows the number of cases adjudicated in each office. panel b shows the number of cases 
adjudicated in each office by a board member with the characteristic indicated in the first column. note that 
board member characteristics are not mutually exclusive, so numbers in the characteristic breakdown may 
not sum to the total. for example, a case adjudicated by a board member in the toronto office who is male, 
holds a law degree, and was educated outside of canada or the united states, would be counted in three 
rows. in addition, the numbers in the five offices may not sum to the national total because of incomplete 
data. in some instances the board members characteristic was available (i.e. gender) but his or her office of 
appointment was not.

134

journal on migration and human securityestimation strategy
the  effect  of  board  member  characteristics  on  the  probability  that  a  refugee  claim  is 
accepted  is  tested  using  three  empirical  specifications,  detailed  below. the  outcome  of 
interest in all regressions performed is a binary variable that is equal to 1 if a refugee claim 
is accepted and 0 if it is rejected. because the outcome is binary in all cases, the functional 
form chosen for the regression model is a probit model. both the coefficients and discrete 
changes are presented in the results section. linear specifications were run as a check and 
are not presented.

equation 1

the aim of the first specification is to hold constant all available information about the 
refugee  claim  and  test  for  statistically  significant  correlations  between  the  observable 
characteristics of the board members and the probability a claim is accepted. the equation 
is: 

yi= 0 + (membercharacteristics)i + 1claimantgenderi + 2countryi + 3yeari + 4officei + i  
the dependent variable, y, is claim acceptance/rejection. the outcome is modeled to be a 
function of the board member characteristics described in table 4 with fixed effects for the 
claimants country of origin and gender as well as the office and year in which the claim was 
adjudicated. the office fixed effect is intended to capture both the fact that different offices 
may have different informal or unofficial standards and expectations that influence board 
members and that even within nationalities, refugees may sort across offices according to 
characteristics not observed in the data. the year fixed effect controls for the downward 
trend in grant rate over time evident in table 1. the vector of coefficients of interest is 
represented by ().

equation 2

the  analysis  is  then  extended  by  interacting  board  member  gender  with  the  claimant 
gender to test for any marginal effects on the probability that a claim is accepted. in the 
specification below, the variable gender takes a value of 1 if the board member is male 
and 0 if the board member is female. the variable claimant gender takes a value of 1 if 
the claimant is male and 0 if female. the variable gender interaction takes a value of 1 if 
both the claimant and the board member are male. 

yi= 0 + 1genderi + 3genderinteraction + 1claimantgenderi + 2countryi + 3yeari + 4officei + i 
this  regression  is  run  both  with  and  without  controlling  for  the  other  board  member 
characteristics listed in table 7. 

equation 3

a third specification restricts the analysis to years 2009-2011 which contain information 
on whether a claim had a designated representative. the goal is to determine whether there 

135

adjudicator bias and decisions of the irb canada (2006-2011)is a differential impact of the board member having a law degree depending on whether or 
not a case is represented. 

yi= 0 + 1lawdegreei + 2representedclaim + 3repinteraction + 1claimantgenderi + 2countryi + 

3yeari + 4officei + i 

in this equation, the variable lawdegree takes a value of 1 if the board member has a 
law degree, represented claim takes a value of 1 if the refugee claimant has a designated 
representative, and repinteract takes a value of 1 if the claim is represented and the board 
member has a law degree.
finally, the first specification is repeated using only the data from 2011 when information 
was available on whether a principal claim had associated derivative claims. a dummy 
variable  (derivative)  equal  to  1  was  added  if  the  principal  claim  is  associated  with 
derivative claims. 

yi= 0 + 1derivative  + 1claimantgenderi + 2countryi + 3yeari + 4officei + i 

results and interpretation
results  of  the  empirical  specifications  described  above  suggest  that  board  member 
characteristics do have an impact on the probability that a refugee claim is accepted. 

results of equation 1

the  correlation  between  board  member  characteristics  and  the  probability  of  claim 
acceptance is reported in table 7, which shows the coefficients, and table 8, which shows the 
discrete changes, or change in the predicted probability that a claim is accepted associated 
with changes in the independent variables.10 all regressions include fixed regressions are 
first run including each board member characteristic individually (columns 1-10) and then 
effects for claimant gender, country of origin as well as office and year of adjudication, and 
all characteristics together (column 11). results are similar between the regressions that 
include only one characteristic and the final regression which includes all characteristics, 
with the one exception of the coefficient on previous experience with human rights issues. 
differences are noted in the discussion that follows. 

gender

a male adjudicator is associated with a negative discrete change in grant probability of 2.7 
to 1.7 percentage points. the magnitude of the effect shrinks when controlling for other 
board  member  characteristics,  but  remains  statistically  significant. there  is  not  a  large 
published economics literature on the effect of a judges gender on case outcomes. the 
question does receive attention in legal scholarship, but it is often theoretical. kulik, perry 

10  discrete change= p(y|x`, xb =1)-p(y|x`, xb=0) where y is the outcome, xb is the variable of interest, and 
x` is the vector of all other variables.

136

journal on migration and human securityand pepper found no significant effect of gender on case outcomes in their analysis of 
american federal sexual harassment cases (2003, 80), while a 2005 study published in the 
yale law journal found that female judges rule in favor of the plaintiff in sexual harassment 
cases at higher rates than male counterparts (peresie 2005). as a judge or adjudicators 
gender is one of the most easily observable pieces of information, this is a promising area 
for further study in other judicial and quasi-judicial contexts. 

education

the  board  members  education  also  has  a  statistically  significant  association  with  the 
outcome of refugee hearings. more highly educated board members are associated with 
higher grant probabilities. a board member with a law degree was associated with a higher 
probability of claim acceptance on the order of 3 or 4 percentage points. here too, the effect 
attenuates when additional characteristics are included. similarly, having a masters degree 
was associated with a probability increase on the order of 1 to 2 percentage points. a board 
member who was educated outside of the us or canada was associated with a large and 
highly significant impact on grant rates of 8.5 percentage points. this variable may be 
capturing a different aspect of education than years of schooling (as measured by advanced 
degrees). it might be thought of as the effect of a board member with higher than average 
experience with intercultural interaction, or it may be a proxy for board members with 
origins or ties outside of canada, both of which are factors that may make a board member 
better able to communicate with or more sympathetic to refugee claimants. it should be 
noted that educational experiences vary greatly even within the group of board members 
who  are  educated  abroad  and  there  is  potential  for  further  research  to  make  additional 
distinctions. the 21 board members classified as having foreign postsecondary education 
were educated in a diverse set of countries including: barbados, china, germany, ethiopia, 
india, israel, japan, malta, the philippines, poland, japan, and the united kingdom. the 
qualifications that they received abroad also vary. 

prior work experience

previous  occupations  also  yielded  significant  discrete  changes.  previous  work  with 
immigrants or refugees was associated with a 4 percentage point increase in the probability 
of claim acceptance. similarly, previous employment with the irb or cic was associated 
with a 5 percentage point increase in the probability that a claim was accepted. 
perhaps the most counterintuitive result is that previous work with human rights organizations 
is associated with a large negative change in the probability of claim acceptance. a priori, 
one  might  expect  that  previous  involvement  with  organizations  concerned  with  human 
rights would lead a board member to be especially sympathetic to claims that human rights 
are at risk of being violated. this surprising result is perhaps attributable to small sample 
size. only 7 board members had previous work with human rights organizations which 
corresponds to 2,096 cases (3.05 percent) in the sample.11 thus, the sample may not have 
11   the  human  rights  organizations  for  which  the  board  members  worked  include:  unhcr;  canadian 
human rights tribunal; canadian human rights foundation; international committee of the red cross; 
international center for democratic development; human rights commission of quebec; human rights 
tribunal of quebec; and the coalition for visible minority women.

adjudicator bias and decisions of the irb canada (2006-2011)enough power to capture the effect of working in these organizations or the unobserved 
characteristics of individuals who select into these professions. in addition, what constitutes  
previous  work  with  human  rights  was  the  most  subjectively  measured  characteristic. 
another possibility is that domestic and international human rights issues are differentiated, 
so concern for one does not necessarily correspond to concern for the other. if this is the 
case, then involvement with domestic human rights case, then involvement with domestic 
human rights issues through organizations such as the canadian human rights tribunal 
is  not  a  proxy  for  concern  with  human  rights  issues  in  foreign  countries,  and  may  not 
predispose a board member to be sympathetic to refugee claimants. 
previous adjudication experience also yielded a potentially surprising result. experience 
evaluating or critiquing claims might either desensitize or sensitize adjudicators to claims 
of persecution. in any event, in the final regression, previous experience as an adjudicator 
is associated with an eight percentage point increase in the probability of claim acceptance. 
it could be speculated that board members may be inclined to grant status on the margin to 
mitigate the cost of high rates of appeal of negative decisions. 
other than gender, and one possibly spurious result from the coefficient on human rights, 
the other characteristic associated with a decline in the probability of claim acceptance was 
previous experience in law enforcement. this effect is slightly larger in magnitude than the 
effect of a male board member. it could be conjectured that those with a background in law 
enforcement are more oriented and accustomed to scrutinizing credibility than members of 
the general population because those jobs demand a higher level of vigilance and suspicion. 
as a result, they are harsher adjudicators. 

elapsed time

finally, the elapsed time between a board members first appointment and the date the 
decision  was  mailed  had  a  negligible  impact  on  the  probability  of  case  acceptance.  
however, with better timing data, more detailed analysis of how the grant rates of board 
members evolves over time would be an extremely valuable area for future study. 

results of equation 2

after testing for correlations between board member characteristics and grant probability, 
a gender interaction term (a variable equal to 1 if both the board member and claimant are 
both male) was added to test for differential effects of board member gender. table 9 shows 
the results. 
the discrete changes reveal that, relative to female claimants, male claimants probability 
of claim approval is ten percentage points lower. part of this effect may be driven by the 
fact that, in many regions of the world, women are particularly vulnerable to persecution or 
unable to seek state protection due to gender discrimination. it is also possible that female 
claimants are more likely to be accompanied by children and board members may be more 
likely to grant status on the margin if denying status would result in the deportation of 
a minor. if the board member is male, male refugee claimants face an additional three 
percentage point decline in the probability of claim success. 

140

journal on migration and human securityinterestingly, adding the gender interaction term resulted in the male board member variable 
becoming statistically insignificant. this suggests that the lower grant rates of male board 
members are driven by their adjudication of male claims. the discrete changes associated 
with other board member characteristics remained largely unchanged when controlling for 
board member and claimant gender. 

results of equation 3

table 10 reports the results of the third specification which, for years 2009-2011, repeats 
the analysis while controlling for whether or not a claim is represented. the results confirm 
that  a  refugee  claim  that  has  a  designated  representative  has  an  enormous  advantage. 
representation is associated with an increase in the probability of success by 24 percentage 
points. this is not only capturing the benefit of counsel, but also unobserved differences 
between refugee claimants who have the ability (resources, language skills, network of 
peers, etc.) to obtain representation and those who do not. this may also capture differences 
between regions. some localities may have more legal aid and nonprofit support for refugee 
claimants than others. moreover, this estimate likely understates the benefits of counsel 
because abandoned claims are excluded from this analysis, and those without representation 
may  be  more  likely  to  abandon  a  claim  either  willfully  or  by  missing  important  legal 
deadlines. for 2009-2011, while only 11 percent of claims in the entire sample had no 
representation, 60 percent of the abandoned claims had no representation. 
an interaction term was included that is equal to 1 if the claim was represented and the 
board  member  had  a  law  degree.  a  priori,  both  positive  and  negative  effects  could  be 
theorized. perhaps a similar legal training would allow adjudicator and counsel to better 
communicate or allow counsel to speak more persuasively, or perhaps this would foster an 
adversarial relationship. however, no statistically significant effect was observed. 

derivative claims

a major shortcoming of this analysis is the lack of information available about the details 
of the refugee claim. other than country of origin and gender, usable characteristics of the 
claimant were unavailable for the period studied. some data that were available on claim 
characteristics such as type of persecution was incomplete and not standardized across 
years. table 11 attempts to make a final, coarse distinction between types of refugee claims 
by taking advantage of the fact that in 2011 a file of all refugee claims, including both 
principal and derivative claims was released. crucially, the records of derivative claims also 
included the file number of the principal claim, allowing derivative and principal claims to 
be linked. as noted previously, derivative claims can only be successful if the associated 
principal claim is determined to be well-founded. having a derivative claim associated with 
a principal claim can be thought of as a proxy for a claimant having a family. 
an indicator variable was added to the regression analysis to test whether the probability 
of success changes if multiple claims depend on the principal claims success. as shown 
in table 11, a derivative claim is associated with an approximately six percentage point 
increase in the probability of success. this could suggest that board members are more 
reluctant to deny refugee status in cases where a negative decision would result in the

claimants providing corroborating accounts are an evidentiary gain for a refugee claim. 
this analysis is limited by its smaller sample size, as data on derivative claims was only 
available  for  a  single  year.  in  this  smaller  sample,  previous  work  with  human  rights 
organizations was dropped from the regression due to collinearity. 
while seemingly small, the magnitude of the effect of adjudicator characteristics on claim 
outcomes should be considered in relation to the board average grant rate of 46 percent (see 
table 1). the positive effect of having an adjudicator with previous adjudication experience 
is 8 percentage points (see table 8, column 11), or a 17 percent increase in grant probability 
(8/46). table 3 presents the countries with the 25 highest claim success rates in the sample 
(of all countries with at least 50 cases in the data). interpreting these effects another way, a 
17 percent increase in grant probability would move a claim up the list in table 3 sixteen 
places from #19 kenya (with a 71 percent grant rate) to #3 eritrea (with an 88 percent grant 
rate). 

conclusion
absolute uniformity is neither a realistic nor a desirable goal in the adjudication of asylum 
claims. claims from the same country can be founded on radically different grounds, and 
even claimants alleging the same type of persecution can be differentially credible. ideally, 
decision  making  with  such  serious  consequences  would  be  made  carefully  and  with 
consistency across adjudicators. this analysis has shown that the probability a claim is 
accepted is correlated with adjudicator characteristics even when accounting for claimant 
gender, country of origin, year and office processed. moreover, these effects may vary 
according to the claimants characteristics. the findings suggest that board members are not 
approaching cases tabula rasa but rather their decisions are influenced by their educational 
and professional backgrounds.
the findings could support two types of policy interventions: preventative or compensatory. 
these policy approaches are not mutually exclusive, and may in fact be most effective when 
implemented together. preventative policies would seek to mitigate the variation in grant 
rates and the correlations with adjudicator characteristics by changing either the selection 
process or the training of board members to create an administrative tribunal that comes to 
more impartial decisions. however, as previous work has shown, judges in courts of law 
make decisions that are correlated with their own biases. recognizing that this subjective 
element  can  never  fully  be  purged  from  judicial  or  quasi-judicial  decision  making,  the 
second category of policy response would compensate for this by incorporating greater 
checks and balances such as creating avenues for appealing decisions or broadening the 
grounds for appeal. 
canada has implemented changes to its refugee determination system following the passage 
of the balanced refugee reform act of 2010 and the protecting canadas immigration 
system  act  (bill  c-31).  beginning  in  2012,  a  new  refugee  appeal  division  handles 
appeals due to questions of law, fact, or a combination of both.12 however, the opening of 
an appeals process also coincides with legislative changes under bill c-31 which  exclude

adjudicator bias and decisions of the irb canada (2006-2011)exclude appeals by applicants from designated countries of origin (dcos). countries 
are designated based on historical rejection rates above 75 percent or withdrawal rates of 60 
percent. additional countries are designated at the discretion of the minister of citizenship 
and immigration and include those that do not normally produce refugees, but do respect 
human rights and offer state protection (citizenship and immigration canada 2013).13 
cic states that the aim of this policy is to deter abuse of the refugee system by people 
who come from countries generally considered safe[and] ensure that people in need get 
protection fast, while those with unfounded claims are sent home quickly (ibid.). 
unfortunately, the probability of success of all refugee claims is associated with board 
member characteristics, even when holding constant country of origin. thus, all cases are 
subject to bias, both those that are permitted an appeal and those that are not. moreover, 
the historical rate of rejection, which is applied as a criterion for designated countries of 
origin, may also be influenced by the observed associations. the creation of an appeals 
process represents a positive step, but it is only a partial check on the subjective element of 
quasi-judicial decision making.
