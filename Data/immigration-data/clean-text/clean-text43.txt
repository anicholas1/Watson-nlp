executive summary and introduction 
in december 2014, the center for migration studies of new york (cms) 
released  a  paper  that  provides  new  estimates  of  the  us  unauthorized 
resident population (warren 2014). the paper describes the development 
of  a  new  dataset  which  has  detailed  information  about  unauthorized 
residents,  derived  from  data  collected  in  the  us  census  bureaus 
american community survey (acs). the dataset will be useful to scholars, 
researchers,  service-providers,  and  government  officials  in  crafting, 
implementing, and evaluating programs that serve noncitizens, including 
the unauthorized. in addition, the new estimates provide an opportunity 
to examine the dramatic changes in unauthorized immigration in the past 
two decades and the assumptions that have shaped us policies and public 
opinion. 
the  new  dataset,  recent  estimates  of  the  unauthorized  (warren  and 
warren  2013)  and  statistics  on  the  noncitizen  population  from  ipums-
usa (ruggles et al. 2010) highlight several trends related to the decline in 
the unauthorized population, particularly from mexico, and the increasing 
salience of visa overstays in constituting this population. some trends defy 
conventional wisdom and all of them have public policy consequences. in 
particular, we find that: 
  the  unauthorized  resident  population  was  about  a  million  lower  in 

2013 than in 2007.

  the great recession was not the principal cause of population decline.

 2015 by the center for migration studies of new york. all rights reserved.jmhs volume 3 number 1 (2015): 80-108  annual  arrivals  into  the  unauthorized  population  increased  to  more 
than one million in 2000, then began to drop steadily, and have now 
reached their lowest levels since the early 1980s.

  from 2000 to 2012, arrivals from mexico fell by about 80 percent. 
  between 2010 and 2013, the total unauthorized population from mexico 

declined by eight percent. 

  in 2006, the number of arrivals from mexico fell below the total number 

of arrivals from all other countries (combined) for the first time.

  the number who stayed beyond the period authorized by their temporary 
visas (overstays) exceeded the number who entered across the southern 
land border without inspection (ewis) in each year from 2008 to 2012.
while the cms estimates are based on sample data and assumptions that 
are subject to error, these trends are consistent with the best empirical 
information available. 
in november 2014 the obama administration announced an unprecedented 
set  of  executive  action  initiatives.  at  this  writing,  the  deferred  action 
for parental accountability (dapa) program and the expanded deferred 
action for childhood arrivals (daca) program, which would provide work 
authorization  and  temporary  reprieve  from  removal  to  eligible  persons, 
have  been  preliminarily  enjoined.  the  temporary  injunction,  which  the 
us department of justice plans to appeal to the fifth circuit court of 
appeals, comes in response to a legal challenge to the two programs by 26 
states under article ii, section 3 of the us constitution which requires the 
president to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, and under 
the  administrative  procedure  act  (apa).  in  addition,  the  republican 
majorities of the 114th congress have vowed to prevent the implementation 
of these programs.  however, the administration has expressed confidence 
that it will ultimately prevail in court and in its battle with congress over 
these  programs.  meanwhile,  nongovernmental  organizations  (ngos), 
community-based  organizations  (cbos),  and  others  continue  to  plan 
intensively for the dapa and daca programs, as well as for other executive 
action initiatives. 
this  paper  provides  estimates  of  those  who  are  potentially  eligible  for 
dapa  and  daca.  however,  it  also  looks  beyond  dapa  and  daca  to 
make  the  case  for  broad  legislative  reform  in  light  of  long-term  trends 
in  unauthorized  migration  to  the  united  states  and  the  unauthorized 
resident population. in particular, it argues that substantial declines in 
the  unauthorized  populationa  goal  shared  by  partisans  on  both  sides 
of the immigration debatewill require reform of the legal immigration 
system, legalization of a substantial percentage of the unauthorized, and a 
more effective response to nonimmigrant visa overstays.

long-term trends in unauthorized immigrationdefinitions
the following terms are used extensively in this paper:
  cms data (or cms database).  this refers to the detailed estimates of the unauthorized 
resident population for 2010 through 2013 that cms derived primarily from acs data 
for those years (warren 2014). an overview of the methods used to derive the estimates 
is provided in the appendix. 

  arrivals.  in this paper, the term arrivals refers to unauthorized immigrants who 
moved  to  the  united  states  in  a  given  year  or  period.  this  differs  from  the  more 
familiar year-of-entry data in which the population is estimated, for example for 2013, 
and then that population is distributed into years or periods of entry. the latter concept 
omits those who entered the population and then left it before the date of the estimate. 
arrivals, as used here, are actual arrivals and not the number who resided in the country 
at a later date.2 the methodology used to estimate annual arrivals for 1982 to 2012 is 
described in the appendix.

  departures.    as  used  here,  the  term  departures  refers  to  those  who  leave  the 
unauthorized resident population. unauthorized residents can leave that population in 
four ways: they can adjust to legal status, be removed from the united states, leave the 
united states voluntarily, or die. annual estimates of each of these four components for 
1990 to 2009 are shown in table 1.

  ewi (entry without inspection).  the term ewis usually refers to migrants who 
enter across the southern land border without legal documents. for this paper, ewi 
arrivals were computed as (1) 90 percent of the estimated arrivals from mexico, plus 
(2)  88  percent  of  the  estimated  arrivals  from  four  central american  countries:  el 
salvador,  guatemala,  honduras,  and  nicaragua.  details  about  the  methods  used  to 
estimate annual entries of ewis and overstays are provided in the appendix. 

  overstays.  the term overstays refers to foreign-born persons who enter the united 
states with nonimmigrant (temporary) visas and overstay their period of admission 
or otherwise violate the terms of their admission. unauthorized immigrants from all 
but a few countries (primarily mexico and central american countries) are overstays. 
for this paper, overstay arrivals were computed as total arrivals minus estimated ewi 
arrivals.

trends related to new estimates of the us unauthorized 
population

trend  1.  the  unauthorized  resident  population  was  about  one  million 

lower in 2013 than in 2007.
figure 1 shows annual estimates of the us unauthorized resident population from 1990 
2   to illustrate the difference, if one million unauthorized persons arrived in year x and by five years later 
(year y) 500,000 of the year x arrivals had left the unauthorized population, year-of-entry data (in year y) 
would indicate a year x unauthorized population of 500,000; that is, one million arrivals in year x, minus 
the 500,000 departures between years x and y. by contrast, arrivals for year x would still be counted as 
one million.

journal on migration and human securityto 2013. the population increased steadily from 1990 to about 1997 and then grew more 
rapidly between 1998 and 2001. from 2002 to 2007, the population continued to grow 
but at a decreasing rate. the population approached zero growth in 2007, reaching its 
peak of about 12 million in that year. from 2008 to 2013, the population declined at an 
average annual rate of 200,000 per year, falling to 11 million in 2013 (figure 1).

trend 2. the great recession was not the principal cause of population 

decline.
the  great  recession  officially  began  in  december  2007  and  ended  in  june  2009. the 
total unauthorized resident population began to decline in 2008, which many attribute to 
the economic downturn that occurred at about the same time. this assumption is often 
accompanied by the corollary assertion that renewed economic growth will lead to a return 
to previous level of unauthorized resident population growth. in fact, these assertions find 
little, if any, support in the data. the trends in arrivals and departures shown in figure 2 
and table 1 demonstrate that the population would have begun to decline in 2008 even if 
the recession had not occurred. as figure 2 shows, the number of arrivals declined rapidly 
and steadily3 from 2006 through 2009; the recession seems to have had little effect on the 
trend line. 
3   the estimated arrivals shown in figure 2 were computed using a three-year moving average, primarily to 
reduce the effects of heaping (the well-recognized phenomenon in which persons erroneously choose year-
of-entry dates that end in zeros and fives). note, however, that the unadjusted numbers also show a similar 
decline for the 2006 to 2009 period. the original estimates were: 695,000 (2006), 570,000 (2007), 390,000 
(2008), and 395,000 (2009).  

83

long-term trends in unauthorized immigrationuntil  recently,  departures  generally  have  been  ignored  in  discussions  of  unauthorized 
population growth. the number of departures doubled in the 1990s, increasing from 180,000 
in 1990 to 360,000 in 1999 (table 1). departures from the population between 2000 and 
2009 are represented by the gray line in figure 2. after 2000, departures exceeded 450,000 
in most years, and they increased to more than 500,000 in the 2007 to 2009 period.
as shown in figure 2, the trend lines crossed in 2008departures exceeded arrivals
and population growth stopped and then reversed. in summary, the data indicate that the 
decline in the unauthorized population that began in 2008 was the result of a downward 
trend  in  arrivals  after  2000,  marked  by  a  steady  decline  after  2005,  accompanied  by  a 
gradual long-term increase in departures. in short, fairly ordinary demographic trends, and 
not the recession that began at about the same time, led to the decline.

the continued decline in arrivals shown in figure 3 for 2010, 2011, and 2012 (the solid 
black line in figure 3) undermines the proposition that renewed economic growth will 
lead to a return to previous levels of unauthorized population growth. however, the level 
of population growth in recent years has been so close to zero that it is difficult to discern 
a  clear  trend.  the  future  course  of  unauthorized  population  growth  probably  will  be 
determined by policy responses to the new information presented in this papers analysis 
on long-term trends in arrivals, especially the historic decline in arrivals from mexico since 
2000, and the emergence of overstays as the principal mode of entry.

so far in this analysis, we have relied heavily on estimates of arrivals and departures for 
1990 to 2009 that were derived using the residual method. 4 in those estimates, arrivals were 
derived through a detailed demographic accounting of the four components of population 
shown in table 1, columns 5 to 8. from here on, we shift our focus to estimates of long-
4   under the residual method, estimates of the us unauthorized population are derived by subtracting the 
legal foreign-born resident population from us census or survey data on the total foreign-born population, 
with adjustments typically made to account for under-enumeration. estimates based on the residual method 
often rely on other demographic techniques as well (warren 2014).

long-term trends in unauthorized immigrationterm trends in arrivals between 1982 and 2012 derived from the cms database. 
figure  3  shows  a  comparison  of  estimated  trends  in  arrivals  based  on  the  residual 
method, along with estimated trends based on cms data. the broken black line in figure 
3  illustrates:  (1)  the  similarity  in  the  estimated  long-term  patterns  of  arrivals  based  on 
disparate methodologies; and (2) that the method we used to estimate arrivals produces 
patterns that are comparable to the only other estimates available. 
the trend line in arrivals based on the residual method is generally higher that the trend line 
derived from cms data. sorting out the reasons for these differences is beyond the scope 
of this paper; the important point is that the procedure that we devised to estimate the long-
term trends in arrivals works as well as the much more detailed accounting procedures used 
in the residual method. the appendix provides detailed information about the methods 
used to estimate arrivals for 1982 to 2012.

trend 3. annual arrivals into the unauthorized population increased to 
more than one million in 2000, then began to drop steadily, and have now reached 
their lowest levels since the early 1980s.
the solid black trend line in figure 3 shows the estimated number of arrivals each year 
from 1982 to 2012. with one exception, arrivals fluctuated in the 500,000 and 600,000 
range from the early 1980s through the late 1990s. that exception is for the years following 

86

journal on migration and human securitythe passage of the immigration reform and control act of 1986 (irca). estimated arrivals 
increased somewhat from 1988 to 1991 and then returned to their pre-irca levels. in the 
years following passage of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility 
act of 1996, which has been characterized as the harshest immigration legislation in 70 
years (wheeler 2014), arrivals surged to possibly their highest levels in us history. since 
2001, however, annual arrivals have plummeted, reaching their lowest levels in at least 
three decades (figure 3). 
as  annual  arrivals  have  fallen  and  departures  have  increased,  the  average  length  of 
residence of the us unauthorized population has increased. as table 2 shows, 46 percent 
of the unauthorized population in 2000 had resided in the united states for less than five 
years and 26 percent for 10 years of more. by 2013, only 16 percent had resided in the 
united states for less than five years, and a remarkable 60 percent for 10 years or more.

trend 4. from 2000 to 2012, arrivals from mexico fell by about 80 percent.
the number of immigrants arriving from mexico fell from 630,000 in 2000 to 120,000 
in 2012, a drop of about 80 percent. arrivals from mexico most likely reached a historic 
peak in 2000; just twelve years later they had dropped to their lowest levels since the 1970s 
(figure 4).
from the early 1980s to 1997, the number of arrivals from mexico gradually increased, 
from about 350,000 per year to about 400,000 per year. there is a noticeable break in 
the trend line, however, from 1988 to1991 (figure 4). in the first few years following the 
passage of irca, arrivals from mexico increased temporarily and then returned to their 
pre-irca level. overall, approximately 225,000 more unauthorized immigrants arrived 
from mexico in this period than would have arrived in the absence of irca. arrivals from 
mexico currently are less than one-third of the pre-1998 levels shown in figure 4.

trend 5. from 2010 to 2013, the total unauthorized resident population 

from mexico declined by eight percent.
mexican  nationals  have  long  constituted  the  majority  of  unauthorized  residents,  with 
particularly large numbers residing in california and a handful of other states. reliable 
estimates for 2013, for example, indicate that mexicans comprise about 54 percent of the 
unauthorized resident population, with 30 percent living in california and additional large 
percentages in texas, illinois, new york, florida, and new jersey (warren 2014). 
as shown in table 3, the unauthorized resident population from mexico declined by about 
one-half million, or eight percent, from 2010 to 2013. table 3 shows the changes for the 
top 20 states of residence. the largest percentage drop was in alabama where the overall 
numbers are relatively low; the population fell by a third from 2010 to 2013. in utah, the 
population fell by 11,000, or 16 percent, between 2010 and 2013. in twelve of the top 20 
states, the population from mexico declined by eight to 13 percent over the three-year 
period (table 3).
the unauthorized resident population from mexico was unchanged from 2010 to 2013 in 
four western states: texas, washington, oregon, and new mexico (table 3). the number 
from mexico increased in only four states (not shown here): louisiana, idaho, wisconsin, 
and connecticut. the total number living in those four states increased about 20 percent.

long-term trends in unauthorized immigrationtrend 6. in 2006, the number of arrivals from mexico fell below the total 

number of arrivals from all other countries (combined) for the first time.
in  the  previous  section,  we  examined  the  long-term  trend  in  arrivals  of  unauthorized 
residents from mexico. in this section, we compare those arrivals with arrivals from all 
other countries. figure 5 shows the annual number of arrivals from 1982 to 2012 from 
mexico and all other countries. over this period, arrivals from mexico exceeded arrivals 
from  all  other  countries  by  approximately  200,000  per  year  (figure  5).  in  2002,  the 
difference began to narrow as arrivals from mexico dropped rapidly while arrivals from 
other countries leveled off. the trends crossed in 2006, and arrivals from all other countries 
exceeded those from mexico. in 2012, about half as many arrived from mexico as from all 
other countries (figure 5).

to  illustrate  the  historic  decline  in  unauthorized  immigrants  arriving  from  mexico,  we 
computed the percent of total arrivals in the 1982 to 2012 period that were from mexico. 
from 1982 to 1997, the percent arriving from mexico was consistently just below 70 percent 
(figure 6). from 1997 to 2004, the percentage from mexico dropped gradually, falling to 
slightly more than half of all arrivals in 2004. after 2004, the percent from mexico fell 
more rapidly; currently, as noted above, about one third of all arrivals are from mexico.

trend 7. the number who stayed beyond the period authorized by their 
temporary visas (overstays) exceeded the number who entered across the southern 
land border (ewis) in each year from 2008 to 2012.5
much of the public discussion on immigration in recent years has focused on unauthorized 
entries across the us-mexico border. in addition, the lions share of the department of 
homeland  security  (dhs)  immigration-related  funding  supports  border  enforcement. 
dhss enacted budget in 2014 included $12.4 billion in funding for customs and border 
protection  (cbp),  including  $3.7  billion  for  border  security  and  control  between  ports 
of entry, $3.2 billion for border security inspections and trade facilitation, and additional 
amounts for air and marine interdiction ($805 million) and border fencing, infrastructure, 
and  technology  ($351  million)  (dhs  2014).6  moreover,  the  house  of  representatives 
is now considering the secure our borders first act of 2015 (h.r. 399), which would 
authorize additional appropriations of $1 billion per year for each fiscal year between 2016 
through 2025 for border fencing, enforcement technology, roads, staffing, and drones, as 
well as monies for the acquisition of condemned property in the border region (cbo 2015).
far less attention and enforcement funding, however, has been devoted to persons who 
enter with nonimmigrant (temporary) visas and who overstay their period of admission or 
5   see appendix for an explanation of how we derived estimates of the unauthorized, including overstays.
6    in  contrast,  the  2014  enacted  budget  for  immigration  and  customs  enforcement  (ice),  dhss  other 
immigration enforcement agency, was $5.6 billion, with $2.8 billion for detention and removal operations 
(dhs 2014).

long-term trends in unauthorized immigrationotherwise violate the terms of their visas.7 estimates of the number of overstays were first 
reported about 25 years ago (bean, edmonson, and passel 1990; gao 1995; warren 1997).  
in 2014, the congressional research service (crs) reported that overstay estimates had 
ranged from 31% to 57% of the unauthorized population (depending on methodology) 
and that reliable estimates were still not available because dhs lacked reliable data on 
emigration and nonimmigrant departures from the united states (wasem 2014). we used 
data on country of origin and year of entry from the cms database to derive information 
about trends in ewis and overstays over the past 30 years.

system that provides a comprehensive record of non-us-citizens immigration status, including information 
identifying those that stayed longer than their allotted time or left the country after staying longer than their 
allotted time (dhs 2015, 113). cbp devoted $29 million for operations and maintenance of this system in 
fy 2015 (ibid., 146).  
8   estimates derived in the 1990s (gao 1995; warren 1997) indicate that 16 percent of the unauthorized 
resident population from mexico resulted from overstays. we used a more conservative estimate of 10 percent 
for mexico to derive these estimates (see appendix).

to the ones shown. 
as shown in figure 7, both ewis and overstays generally increased from the early 1980s 
until about 1997, surging to a peak in 2000 before declining rapidly from 2001 to 2003. 
note that the irca-related bump in 1988-1991 was more pronounced for ewis than 
for overstays. for more than two decades, from 1982 to 2003, the trends were roughly 
parallel, with ewis exceeding overstays by about 250,000 to 300,000 each year. however, 
after 2003, the trend lines converge; ewis declined sharply, falling from a half million in 
2004 to about 150,000 in 2012 (figure 7). overstays also declined from 2004 to 2012, but 
the drop was not as steep or as consistent as the decline in ewis. the largest shift in the 
number of overstays relative to ewis occurred from 2003 to 2008. in the 2008 to 2012 
period, a total of 270,000 more overstayed than arrived as ewis. entries of ewis are now 
far below the levels estimated from 1982 to 2006, while overstays have remained near their 
long-term levels.10

9   an unreasonable assumption would be one that produced trend lines that implied no population growth 
from 1982 to 1997 or that implied more population growth than has been reported (see, for example, table 
1, column 2). 
10   note also that the gray trend line for the most recent years shown for overstays in figure 7 is likely to rise 
somewhat over the next few years as visitors and others who entered with temporary visas in recent years 
are in the country long enough to overstay. for example, the temporary visitor who is in a legal status in late 
2012, but subsequently fails to depart, will not appear in the estimates as an overstay in 2012. however, when 
comparable data are compiled in, say 2015, that person will report 2012 as the year of entry and will appear 
in the data as an overstay who entered in 2012.

93

long-term trends in unauthorized immigrationfigure 8 charts the long-term trend in the percent of all arrivals that were overstays. until 
the mid- to late 1980s, between 25 and 30 percent of all unauthorized immigrant arrivals 
were overstays. in the 1998 to 2004 period, overstays increased to just over one-third of 
all arrivals; after 2004, the percent of overstays increased rapidly, finally becoming the 
majority of arrivals from 2008 to 2012 (figure 8).
the  next  step  in  assessing  long-term  trends  in  overstays  compared  to  ewis  is  to  plot 
the pattern of arrivals from each continent or area. figure 9 provides an overview of the 
trends in arrivals from north, central, and south america, the caribbean, africa, and asia. 
europe  and  oceania  have  been  omitted  because  the  numbers  are  relatively  small. the 
graphs embedded in figure 9 do not show ewis or overstays separately; however, the 
trends in ewis and overstays can be discerned in figure 9 because most of the arrivals 
from north and central america are ewis and most of the arrivals from the rest of the 
world are overstays. note that the vertical scales vary in the graphs shown in figure 9; the 
intent is to show patterns of entry and not relative levels of arrivals.

the  patterns  of  arrival  illustrated  in  figure  9  help  to  explain  why  nonimmigrant  visa

(the source of most ewis) fell to historic lows, while arrivals from the caribbean, africa 
and asia (who are very nearly all overstays) continued at previous levels or increased.

policy discussion
over the last decade, congress has failed to pass comprehensive reform legislation. in 
response, in november 2014 the obama administration announced an unprecedented set 
of executive action initiatives.12 according to our estimates, there are 3.9 million parents 
of us citizens and lawful permanent residents (lprs) who would be prima facie eligible 
for work authorization and a temporary reprieve from removal under the deferred action 
for  parental accountability  (dapa)  program  (warren  2014). an  additional  1.5  million 
unauthorized persons, who were brought to the united states as children, would potentially 
qualify for the expanded deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program (ibid.).13 
tables 4 and 5 show our estimates of the persons potentially eligible for the dapa and 
daca programs in the top 15 states of residence and the top 15 countries of origin.14 
12    although  the  dapa  and  daca  programs  have  received  the  most  attention  among  the  obama 
administrations  recently  announced  executive  action  initiatives,  a  third  initiative  has  the  potential  to 
facilitate family unity and legal status for large numbers of persons with family ties to us citizens and lawful 
permanent residents (lprs) that qualify them for an immigrant visa. to explain, after a family-based visa 
petition has been approved (signifying the existence of a qualifying family relationship), many unauthorized 
persons choose to wait in the united states (without status) until their visa priority date becomes current. 
at that point, they must leave the country to secure the visa through consular processing. however, once 
they leave, they become inadmissible based on their past unauthorized presence in the united states. the 
ground of inadmissibility can be waived based on extreme hardship to a us citizen or lpr spouse or 
parent, but the waiver process has historically taken place abroad and its outcome is uncertain. as a result, 
many opt to remain in the united states and forego the possibility of a visa. in january 2013, dhs issued a 
rule that allowed the spouses, parents and minor children of us citizens to seek a waiver of inadmissibility 
before they leave the united states. once a waiver has been approved, they can then leave the country to 
pursue  consular  processing  with  the  assurance  they  will  be  permitted  to  return.  in  november  2014,  the 
president announced the expansion of this process to cover the spouses, sons and daughters of lprs, and the 
adult and married sons and daughters of us citizens. this measure will benefit thousands of family members 
of us citizens and lprs each year into perpetuity. 
13   as stated, the 114th congress has vowed to derail these programs, and 26 states have challenged their 
constitutionality.
14   an estimated 262,000 persons are eligible for both dapa and daca.

in the absence of federal legislation, a dynamic new immigration federalism has emerged, 
with states and localities taking remarkably diverse approaches to unauthorized residents 
and  their  family  members,  ranging  from  strategies  to  exclude,  marginalize,  and  spur 
their self-deportation, to measures that would extend to them many of the benefits and 
conditions of legal residency (suro 2015). 
immigration enforcement has been a priority of successive administrations and congresses 
(kerwin 2014, 329-332). yet many border residents resent the intrusiveness of enforcement 
policies in their lives and the repeated characterization of their communities as dangerous 
and  insecure  (heyman  2013).  in  fy  2014,  there  was  a  dramatic  increase  in  migration 
to  the  united  states  by  unaccompanied  children  and  parents  with  minor  children  from 
the  northern  triangle  nations  of  central  america.  in  response,  the  united  states  has 
sought to deter further migration through removals, detention of families, increased border 
enforcement, and work with sending states.15

some view these developmentsin combinationas evidence that the united states is on 
a slow path to consensus on immigration reform. others think that meaningful immigration 
reform discussions have reached a dead-end, and will not be revived for years. we believe 
that the trends outlined in this paper argue for re-engagement of the debate on the need for 
broad legislative reform, whatever its political prospects and whatever the ultimate fate of 
the dapa and expanded daca programs. before we discuss the policy implications of the 
trends set forth in this paper, however, we should pause to acknowledge the importance of 
now having the information needed to chart those trends via the cms database, as well as 
through other scholarship, research, and data tools.

growth of the unauthorized resident population 

in the 1980s and 1990s, it seemed that the unauthorized population might continue to grow 
indefinitely. we could not have anticipated the remarkable decline in unauthorized arrivals 
after 2000. nor did demographers have sufficient data to recognize the steady growth in 
the number of departures from the populationprimarily through voluntary emigration, 
removal by dhs, or adjustment to legal status. 

97

long-term trends in unauthorized immigrationthe  question  of  why  the  population  stopped  growing  in  2008  is  not  just  an  academic 
exercise. the generally accepted but erroneous assumption that the recession was the cause 
of the decline reveals a widely shared assumption that unauthorized population growth 
is inevitable. that mindset has led to a perpetual sense of crisis. one of the purposes of 
this paper is to help policymakers and the public dispel the myth of inevitable population 
growth and to appreciate fully the dramatic changes that have occurred over the past fifteen 
years. that should set the stage for a renewed consideration of comprehensive reform.
it would be risky for demographers to try to predict whether the population will start to 
grow again and, if so, why and at what rate. however, if we assume continued robust levels 
of border enforcement, and if congress and dhs start to focus more attention on tracking, 
reducing and preventing the admission of likely overstays, it appears likely that the era 
of large increases in the unauthorized resident population will have ended.16 moreover, 
providing a reprieve from removal for millions of parents of us citizens and lprs, as 
well as for an expanded group of unauthorized persons brought to the united states as 
children, would allow dhs to concentrate its substantial enforcement resources on high-
priority  targets,  like  human  traffickers,  transnational  criminal  enterprises,  and  national 
security threats. at the same time, as discussed below, substantial future declines in the 
us unauthorized population are likely to come only from reform of the legal immigration 
system and creation of a path to citizenship for us unauthorized residents. 

unauthorized  immigration  as  a  transitional  status  and  the 
increase  in  the  average  length  of  residency  of  us  unauthorized 
immigrants 
these estimates also strongly affirm past research on the transitional nature of immigration 
status, as evidenced by the high percentages of unauthorized immigrants who may already 
be eligible for lpr status (wong et al. 2014) and the high percentage of new lprs who 
once lacked immigration status (jasso et al. 2008). as figure 3 illustrates, an estimated 
19.5 million17 persons joined the unauthorized population in the 31-year period from 1982 
to 2012. of this number, 11.0 million were still living in the united states without status 
in 2013. that leaves about 8.5 million who: (1) were no longer in the united states; or 
(2) were able to adjust to legal status. although dhs does not compile the number of 
adjustments from unauthorized to legal status, estimates such as those shown in table 1 for 
the 1990 to 2009 period indicate that approximately two million adjusted to legal status in 
the 1982 to 2012 period. thus, 6.5 million who entered in 1982 to 2012 left voluntarily, 
were removed, or died. 
the fluidity of the us unauthorized population has received only sparse attention in the 
public debate on immigration reform. however, it has profound implications for reform of 
the legal immigration system and for immigration enforcement strategies. in particular, it 
casts doubt on the wisdom of seeking to remove persons who are already on the path to 
lpr status. these include a substantial number of the 4.4 million persons whose family-
16   we would note, however, that whatever its deterrent effect on unauthorized migration, the growth in 
border enforcement has irrefutably reduced return migration rates to mexico (massey, durand, and pren 
2014, 1042-43). 
17   the sum of the annual arrivals shown in figure 3 (the solid black line) is 19.5 million.

journal on migration and human securitybased visa petitions have been approved, but who wait in visa backlogs due to per-country 
visa limits and annual caps on visas in family-based preference categories (bergeron 2013, 
7). an unknown, but certainly a high percentage of those with approved family-based visa 
petitions choose to reside in the united states (in unauthorized status) as they wait for their 
visa priority date to become current. moreover, the us unauthorized population includes 
high percentages of persons with long tenure, including 1.9 million with 20 years or more 
of us residency, 1.6 million with 15 to 19 years of us residency, and 3.1 million with 10 
to 14 years of us residency (warren 2014). 
as  discussed,  the  average  length  of  residency  of  the  us  unauthorized  population  has 
increased significantly in recent years, and this trend will persist if arrivals to the unauthorized 
population remain low and departures from this population continue to increase or level 
off. these  long-term  residents,  which  include  high  percentages  of  potential  dapa  and 
daca beneficiaries, will continue to build family and other equitable ties to the united 
states, diminishing the likelihood that they will ever return permanently to their countries 
of birth. as figure 10 shows, many of the potential dapa and daca beneficiaries are 
long-term residents; in both cases, more than half of them arrived before 2000.

the escalating numbers of long-term us unauthorized residents argue, in particular, for 
revisiting a legalization policy option that has received scant attention in the debate on 
immigration reform. registry provides lpr status to unauthorized us residents who 
have  entered  the  country  by  a  statutorily  established  date  (currently  january  1,  1972), 
have lived continuously in the country since entry, are not removable on select grounds of

long-term trends in unauthorized immigrationinadmissibility or deportability, and are not ineligible for citizenship.18 since 1929, congress 
has advanced the registry date several times, most recently through irca (kerwin 2010). 
as a result, more than 72,000 persons have received legal status via registry, including 
more than 63,000 in the post-irca years from 1987 through 1990 (ibid.). advancing the 
registry date would be an effective way to address the long-term unauthorized population 
that includes 1.9 million persons who have lived in the united states for 20 years or more, 
and 1.6 million unauthorized residents for 15 to 19 years (warren 2014). to move ahead 
the registry cut-off date on a rolling basis (automatically) thereafter would prevent the re-
emergence of a long-tenured unauthorized population.  
in short, the trends in unauthorized immigration support what policymakers increasingly 
recognize:  that  self-deportation  or  removal-only  policies  would  be  harmful  to  the 
unauthorized,  their  families,  and  their  communities,  and  that  ultimately  reform  of  the 
legal immigration system and a path to citizenship for some substantial percentage of the 
unauthorized will be the best and perhaps only feasible policy option.  

entries across the southern land border 

the decade-long drop in arrivals from mexico after 2000to approximately one-third of 
the number of annual arrivals in the early 1980smay be the most striking trend described 
in this paper. the pew research center attributed the decline in net migration from mexico 
(legal and unauthorized) to many factors, including the weakened us job and housing 
construction markets, heightened border enforcement, a rise in deportations, the growing 
dangers associated with illegal border crossings, the long-term decline in mexicos birth 
rates and broader economic conditions in mexico (passel, cohn, and gonzalez-barrera 
2012,  6).  an  analysis  of  mexican  migration  project  data  has  attributed  the  marked 
decline in first unauthorized migration entirely to the rising average age of household 
heads at risk of taking a first undocumented trip (massey, durand, and pren 2014, 1055). 
the increase in average age of potential migrantsfrom 22.5 to 45.9 years old between 
1970 and 2010is due, in turn, to the steep drop in the mexican fertility rate, coupled with 
the steady selection of young men out of the population at risk of taking a first trip by 
migration itself (ibid.).
from a policy perspective, the time has come to reform the us legal immigration system, 
with the goals of better serving the nations economic, family, and humanitarian interests; 
further reducing arrivals into the unauthorized population; permanently diminishing this 
population;  and  increasing  the  effectiveness  of  the  immigration  enforcement  system. 
channeling  needed  workers  legally  through  ports  of  entry  would  change  the  dynamics 
at the border. it would allow cbp to shift the substantial resources it devotes now to the 
apprehension  of  economic  migrants,  to  the  prevention  of  entries  by  public  safety  and 
national security risks, to interdiction of the flow of illegal narcotics to the united states, 
and to curtailing flows of illegal firearms and drug profits from the united states to mexican 
cartels. more targeted enforcement strategies would also lessen the resentment of many 
border residents at the omnipresence of the border patrol and at intrusive enforcement 
activities in their communities.

journal on migration and human securitythe surge in arrivals by central american and mexican youth, peaking in 2014, illustrates 
the limits of border enforcement policies. it points to the need to address the structural 
conditions  leading  to  their  migrationprimarily  violence  and  povertythrough  social 
reform,  economic  development,  rule-of-law  initiatives,  and  humanitarian  programs  in 
sending  communities.  the  migration  of  children  is  also  strongly  tied  to  the  migration 
history of their parents, including (for many) their parents residence in the united states 
(donato and sisk 2015). this phenomenon argues for legalization and legal immigration 
policies that reflect the nations commitment to family unity. such policies, in turn, have the 
potential to reduce unauthorized migration and contribute to a more effective and humane 
enforcement system. 

overstays

as  unauthorized  entries  across  the  us-mexico  border  have  declined,  overstays  have 
become a much more important source of unauthorized immigration. the reversal in 
modes of entry should lead to an increased emphasis on preventing likely overstays, and 
keeping track of visitors and others who are admitted temporarily. a 1994 report from the 
immigration and naturalization service stated: it is clear that nonimmigrant overstays 
make up a large percentage of the unauthorized immigrant population residing in the united 
states. yet this group has generally been overlooked in discussions of us policy options for 
reducing unauthorized immigration (warren 1994).  more than two decades later, this trend 
persists.
as of june 2013, dhs had more than one million arrival records which lacked matching 
departure records in its arrival and departure information system (adis) database (gao 
2013, 16). a gao analysis of unmatched arrival records in november 2012 found that 
the average elapsed time since the date of required departure was 2.7 years (ibid., 18). 
not  surprisingly,  a  particular  challenge  in  identifying  overstays  has  been  incomplete 
collection of departure data from nonimmigrants at ports of entry, particularly land ports 
of entry (20). this remains an immense challenge along the us-mexico border, as does 
inaccurate  information  provided  by  air  carriers  on  passenger  departures  (25).  in  recent 
years, dhs has taken steps to enhance data sharing between adis and other dhs databases 
that allow it to identify persons who have departed in a timely manner or changed status 
(i.e., non-overstays), as well as overstays who fall within ice enforcement priorities (20-
21). yet in 2014, crs observed that dhs still did not have reliable data on emigration 
and  nonimmigrant  departures  from  the  united  states  and  that  a  way  forward  on  the 
issue of nonimmigrant overstays seems out of reach, absent a reliable method to measure 
emigration or an effective exit-monitoring system (wasem 2014).
this  is  not  an  argument  for  revisiting  the  exit  requirements  of  the  automated  entry-
exit system mandated by the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility 
act of 1996 and subsequent acts of congress. in any event, recent reports indicate that 
dhs has no plans to implement biometric exit capabilities at land ports of entry (gao 
2013, 28). however, our finding that overstays have outnumbered ewis for the past five 
years speaks to the urgent need for a viable statistical system to collect information about 
all entries to and departures from the united states. investment in a more reliable and 
efficient entry/exit and tracking system would allow dhs to monitor a significant portion 

101

long-term trends in unauthorized immigrationof  the  unauthorized  population  that  has  gone  largely  unnoticed  and  ignored  until  now. 
more importantly, intensive tracking and evaluation of overstays would generate detailed 
feedback that could assist dhs and embassy personnel to identify visa applicants that are 
at high risk of becoming overstays. 

summary
this report documents profound recent changes in unauthorized immigration to the united 
states. between 2000 and 2012, arrivals of unauthorized immigrants from mexico fell by 
80 percent, and the total population (and the population from mexico) began to decline. 
these developments were offset somewhat by an unexpected trend. after 2008, entering 
legally with a temporary visa and overstaying became the predominant way to enter the 
unauthorized resident population. the decline of the unauthorized population in the future 
will depend on reform of the legal immigration system, legalization of a large percentage 
of the unauthorized, and making overstays an enforcement priority. in other words, it will 
require the administration and congress to work together to develop a more effective and 
humane immigration system. 

appendix

overview of the methodology used to derive center for 
migration studies (cms) estimates
the estimates are based partly on the reported characteristics of non-us citizens in the micro 
data of the 2010 american community survey (acs). the acs is an annual statistical 
survey covering approximately one percent of the total us population. the survey gathers 
information previously obtained in the decennial censusthe acs questionnaires are very 
similar to the 2000 census long form. the survey provides detailed social and economic 
data for all states, as well as all cities, counties, metropolitan areas, and population groups 
of 100,000 people or more.
nearly  all  of  the  unauthorized  resident  population  in  the  acs  is  in  the  category  of 
noncitizens that entered the united states after 1981. very few who entered before 1982 
would still be residing in the country as unauthorized residents in 2010 because: (1) a large 
percentage of those who entered before 1982 obtained legal status under the immigration 
reform and control act of 1986 (irca);19 and, (2) the remainder have had about 30 years 
in which to leave the unauthorized resident populationthat is, to adjust to legal status, be 
removed, leave voluntarily, or die. 

19   irca went into effect in 1987. two main groups were eligible for legalization, each with their own 
residency requirements: legalization applicants who continuously resided in the united states since before 
january 1, 1982 and special agricultural workers (saws) who had 60 days of seasonal agricultural work 
experience in qualifying crops from may 1985 to may 1986. about 1.6 million legalization applicants and 
1.1 million saw applicants were approved.

journal on migration and human securitythe methodology involved four major steps. 
1.  a series of edits, referred to as logical edits, 20 were used to identify as many legal 
residents as possible based on responses in the survey. those judged to be legal residents 
were removed from the data. at this point about 86 percent of those remaining were 
likely to be unauthorized residents. 

2.  separate population estimates of unauthorized residents counted in the 2010 acs, for 

145 countries or areas, were derived for use as population controls.

3.  the population controls for each country were used to make final selections of individual 

respondents in the acs to be classified as unauthorized residents. 

4.  finally, the results of step 3 were adjusted for under-enumeration. the most recent 
entrants are assumed to have the highest undercount rates (about 13 percent), and the 
undercount rate drops steadily with length of residence, falling to less than two percent 
for those who entered in 1982. the estimated undercount rate for the total population 
is about 7.5 percent.

the technique of controlling the likely unauthorized population to 145 country controls 
produced estimates by age, year of entry, and state of residence that are very similar to the 
best available residual estimates. the estimates for each country used as population controls 
for the 2010 estimates are based partly on administrative data from the department of 
homeland security (dhs), estimates and assumptions consistent with warren and warren 
(2013), and a variety of other sources, including foreign-born data from the 2000 census, 
legalization applications by country from irca, and estimates of nonimmigrant overstays, 
by country, derived by dhs annually from 1988 to 1992. for a complete description of the 
procedures for deriving the population controls for each country, see warren (2014).
for most countries the logical edits (step 1) produce numbers that are fairly close to the 
control totals. however, the logical edits do not shift all of the legal residents out of the 
likely unauthorized category. as  a  result,  a  small  percentage of  those  remaining in  the 
database actually are legal residents. on the other hand, a sizeable proportion of these legal 
residents had previous experience as unauthorized residents. overall, the database consists 
of  an  estimated  89  percent  unauthorized  residents,  but  adding  in  those  with  previous 
unauthorized experience raises the total to 93 percent.

methodology for estimating actual arrivals
the  usual  way  of  describing  entry  data  for  immigrants  is  to  tabulate  the  number  of 
immigrants who lived in the united states in a particular year, for example those counted 
in the 2013 acs, and distribute the data into years or periods of entry. this procedure 

20   the term logical edit refers to the process of determining probable legal status by examining survey 
data. respondents were assigned to the legal category if they worked in occupations that generally require 
legal status, were legal temporary migrants, were immediate relatives of us citizens, received public benefits, 
were from countries where most arrivals would be refugees, or were age 60 or older at entry. this method was 
developed by jeffrey passel and rebecca clark (1998), extended by passel, bean and van hook (2004), and 
refined by passel and others in recent years at the pew research center.

103

long-term trends in unauthorized immigrationis  useful  for  some  purposes,  such  as  describing  the  current  population  or  planning  for 
administrative programs in which length of residence is important. however, this approach 
is  inadequate  for  describing  trends  in  the  number  who  actually  arrived  each  year.  for 
example, the number of unauthorized immigrants who moved to the united states in 1988 
will be greatly diminished by 2013; that is, a large percentage of those who entered in 1988 
will have left the unauthorized population in one of four ways: adjusted to legal status, 
been removed by dhs, left voluntarily, or died. to examine long-term trends in arrivals, 
we need to know how many actually arrived each year, not just the number still residing in 
the united states in 2013.
if adequate detailed information had been available, we would have started with the 2013 
count of those who entered in 1988, for example, and added back all of those who left in 
any of the four ways listed above. unfortunately, the information needed for such cohort 
restoration is not available by country of birth. however, sufficient data was available and 
that technique was used successfully to estimate total actual arrivals for us states and the 
total population for 1990 to 2009 (warren and warren, 2013). we used the pattern of those 
annual us estimates of entries to calibrate and validate our methodology.

journal on migration and human securityfor this paper, we developed a new procedure for estimating actual arrivals for 1982 to 
2012. to produce the estimates, we carried out the following steps:
1.  compiled data by single year of entry for 1982 to 2012 from the cms estimates of the 

unauthorized resident population in 2013;

2.  used an annual loss rate of three percent per year to reconstruct each annual entry 
cohort. operationally, we divided those who entered in 2011 (from step 1 above) by 
0.97; those who entered in 2010 by 0.94; those who entered in 2009 by 0.91, and so on, 
back to 1982.

3.  in most cases, we smoothed the results by using a three-year moving average, and then 

rounded to 5,000s. 

the results were tested by comparing the cms trends with the trends in arrivals published 
by warren and warren (2013); the two trend lines are shown in figure 11. the gray line 
in figure 11 is the estimated population in 2013, distributed by reported year of entry. the 
solid black line shows our estimates of the number who actually entered in each year. the 
broken black line shows the estimates derived using demographic accounting. our trend 
line is generally lower, but the two long-term trends are about parallel, which lends support 
to our methodology.

estimates of overstays and ewis
previous studies indicate that the overwhelming majority of individuals who cross the us-
mexico land border without inspection (ewis) come from mexico and central american 
countries (warren 1997; gao 1995; bean, edmonson, and passel 1990). beyond that, 
the information about the relative numbers of ewis and overstays by country of origin is 
sparse. we derived the estimates of ewis and overstays shown here based partly on data 
derived by the immigration and naturalization service (ins) and used in warren (1997). 
in that report, average annual overstays for 1985 to 1992 were estimated to be 47,500 from 
mexico and 14,600 from el salvador, guatemala, honduras, and nicaragua combined. 
dividing those figures by our comparable estimates of arrivals for 1985 to 1992 (the arrivals 
used to construct figure 3) from mexico and the four central american countries yields 
11 percent overstays from mexico and 18 percent overstays from the central american 
countries.
based on the information above, we made the following assumptions: 90 percent of all 
arrivals in 1982-2012 from mexico were ewis, and 88 percent of all arrivals in 1982-2012 
from the four central american countries were ewis. all of the arrivals from the rest of 
the world were assumed to be overstays. arrivals of overstays for figures 7 and 8 were 
computed as the difference between total arrivals and estimated ewi arrivals from mexico 
and central america. 
to try to avoid overestimating overstays, we used 10 percent (rather than the computed 
11 percent) overstays from mexico, and 12 percent (rather than the computed 18 percent) 
overstays from the four central american countries. sensitivity tests showed that reasonable 
alternative assumptions about percent overstays from these five countries produced long-
term trends similar to those shown in figures 7 and 8.
