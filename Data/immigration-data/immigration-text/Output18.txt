us undocumented population 
drops below 11 million in 2014, 
with continued declines in 
the mexican undocumented 
population

executive summary
undocumented immigration has been a significant political issue in recent 
years, and is likely to remain so throughout and beyond the presidential 
election year of 2016. one reason for the high and sustained level of interest 
in undocumented immigration is the widespread belief that the trend in 
the undocumented population is ever upward. this paper shows that this 
belief is mistaken and that, in fact, the undocumented population has been 
decreasing for more than a half a decade. other findings of the paper that 
should inform the immigration debate are the growing naturalized citizen 
populations in almost every us state and the fact that, since 1980, the 
legally resident foreign-born population from mexico has grown faster than 
the undocumented population from mexico.

introduction
this paper sets forth detailed estimates of the us undocumented population in 2014 by the 
center for migration studies of new york (cms). it reports that the total undocumented 
population declined in 2014, as it has done in each year since 2008. the population fell 
below 11 million for the first time since 2004. the mexican-born undocumented population 
also continued its steady decline; the population has fallen by more than 600,000 since 
2010. 
this paper describes trends in the undocumented population over the past few years for 
selected countries of origin and states of residence. the annual estimates for 2010 to 2014 
were derived by cms based on statistics on the foreign-born population collected in the 
census bureaus american community survey (acs),1 as described in warren (2014). 

1   the acs is an annual statistical survey covering approximately 1 percent of the total us population. the 
survey gathers information previously obtained in the decennial census  the acs questionnaires are very 
similar to the 2000 census long form. the survey provides detailed social and economic data for all states, as 
well as all cities, counties, metropolitan areas, and population groups of 100,000 people or more.

 2016 by the center for migration studies of new york. all rights reserved.jmhs volume 4 number 1 (2016): 1-15the estimates for years prior to 2010 are based on estimates published in the international 
migration review (warren and warren 2013). the sources of data and methodology are 
summarized at the end of the paper.

major findings
the paper finds that:
  the total us undocumented population continued to decline in 2014 and has fallen by 

more than a million since 2008; 

  the  undocumented  population  of  the  majority  of  us  states  declined  after  2008; 

however, 11 states reached their maximum population in 2014, including texas;

  with the exception of alabama and possibly georgia, restrictive state immigration laws 

in 2010-2011 had little impact on undocumented population trends;

  the mexican-born undocumented population was about 600,000 smaller in 2014 than 

  about 250,000 fewer undocumented immigrants from mexico lived in california in 

  from 1980 to 2014, the legally resident population from mexico grew faster than the 

it was in 2010;

2014 compared to 2010; and,

mexican undocumented population. 

population trends

total population

the total undocumented population declined to about 10.9 million in 2014, reaching its 
lowest  level  since  2003. the  population  has  fallen  by  more  than  a  million  since  2008 
(figure  1).  determining  the  specific  reasons  for  the  population  changes  described  here 
is outside the scope of this report. clearly, however, the sharp reduction in arrivals from 
mexico  in  the  past  10  years  has  played  a  significant  role  (see  figure  4  in warren  and 
kerwin 2015, 86-87).
figure 1 shows estimates of the total undocumented population from 2008 to 2014. the 
population has declined by an average of almost 200,000 each year since 2008. the pattern 
of decline for the total population is largely driven by the decline of undocumented residents 
from mexico. however, undocumented populations from other nations contributed to the 
trend; indeed, as shown in a later section, undocumented populations from a majority of 
other countries declined in the 2010 to 2014 period2 (table 5).

2    estimates  are  available  annually  for  1990  to  2014  for  each  state  and  for  the  total  us  undocumented 
population; however, the country-by-country estimates are not available for years before 2010. that is why 
the discussion of changes by country of origin is limited to the 2010 to 2014 period.

figure 2 shows the amount that the total undocumented population changed each year from 
2003 to 2014. the sharp reduction in population growth began in 2007, well before the 
onset of the great recession. the steady downward trend continued from 2006 to 2011 
(figure 2). the total undocumented population has declined in each of the past six years, 
although the rates of decline slowed from 2011 to 2014.

table 1 shows the 20 states with the largest number of undocumented residents in 2014. 
estimates are shown for each year from 2010 to 2014 to demonstrate the consistency in the 
annual state-by-state estimates. note the steady population decline in the states that lost 
the largest numbers from 2010 to 2014  california, new york, and illinois (table 1). of 
the 10 states with the highest undocumented populations in 2014, only texas and virginia 
gained undocumented residents from 2010 to 2014. over that period, the gain for texas 
and virginia combined was 36,000; the other eight states in the top 10 lost a total of about 
750,000.

journal on migration and human securityas  shown  in  table  1,  the  undocumented  population  in  california  dropped  by  318,000 
from 2010 to 2014. it is possible to determine which countries were most responsible for 
the decline in each state because the estimates are cross-tabulated by state of residence 
and country of origin. much of the decline in the undocumented population in california 
occurred because of the drop in the number from mexico; the number fell by about 250,000 
from 2010 to 2014 (table 2).

table 3 shows a similar decline in the undocumented population in new york from 2010 
to  2014. the  countries  with  the  largest  numerical  declines  were  mexico,  ecuador,  and 
jamaica (table 3, column 6). the undocumented population from poland, living in new 
york, experienced the largest percentage decline, with a decrease of 37 percent.
in  the  2010-2011  period,  legislation3  was  enacted  in  a  number  of  states  to  reduce  the 
undocumented resident population. the estimates presented here can be used to help assess 
the demographic impact of those legislative efforts on the undocumented population in 
each state.

3   the arizona law, enacted in april 2010, was the prototype for other states. support our law enforcement 
and  safe  neighborhoods  act,  s.b.  1070,  49th  leg.,  2nd  reg.  sess.  (ariz.  2009).  among  many  other 
provisions, the law required police officers to check the immigration status of anyone they lawfully stopped, 
arrested, or detained. an earlier arizona law required businesses to use the e-verify (electronic verification) 
system to check the legal status of workers. omnibus state immigration enforcement bills were also passed 
in georgia, alabama, south carolina, indiana, and utah.

figure 3 shows trends in the size of the undocumented populations of georgia, arizona, 
and alabama  from  2008  to  2014. all  three  states  experienced  rapid  population  growth 
from 1990 to 2010 (warren and warren 2013). from 2010 to 2014, the undocumented 
population declined in each state. during that period, the population fell by about 45,000 
in georgia, 20,000 in arizona, and 30,000 in alabama (figure 3). the drop of about 20,000 
in arizona from 2010 to 2014 is far below the speculative figure of 200,000 that has been 
reported.4

4   for example, nbc latino reported that arizonas undocumented population [went] down by 200,000 in 
a few years (nuo 2014). 

journal on migration and human securitybased on the trends in the undocumented population in georgia and arizona (figure 3), it 
does not appear that the legislation in those two states had a lasting impact on the size of 
either population. population decline had already begun in both states before the laws were 
passed, and the population could have fallen to the 2014 levels even if the legislation had 
not been enacted. 
the decline in the undocumented population in arizona in recent years has been accompanied 
by a steady increase in the number of naturalized citizens (figure 4). from 2008 to 2014, 
the undocumented population in arizona dropped by 65,000, and the naturalized citizen 
population increased by 85,000. 
the trends for 2008 to 2014 shown for arizona in figure 4  a steady decline in the 
undocumented population accompanied by a steady increase in the naturalized population 
 is a pattern that is repeated for nearly every state.5 although the trends regarding these 
populations could be unrelated, the intersecting lines might well portend future political 
changes.

declined in 26 states and increased in 24. the largest declines were in california (-42,000), 
illinois (-41,000), and texas (-33,000) (table 4). the states with the largest increases in

the 2014 decline in the undocumented population from mexico continues a trend of half a 
decade. since 2010, the total undocumented population from mexico has declined by about 
612,000, or 9 percent.  although the estimates in table 4 contain sampling variability, 
the  numbers  establish  that,  in  many  of  the  larger  states,  the  undocumented  population 
from mexico declined from 2010 to 2014 substantially more than the national average 
of 9 percent.  for example, the number of undocumented residents from mexico living in 
california dropped by about 250,000, or 13 percent, from 2010 to 2014. other states with 
substantial decreases in undocumented residents from mexico in the same period included 
illinois (-21%), georgia (-15%), and new jersey (-14%) (table 4).
of  the  top  15  states  of  residence  of  undocumented  immigrants  from  mexico,  none 
increased from 2010 to 2014, and only four states lost less than 5 percent of their mexican 
undocumented  population:  florida  (no  change),  texas  (-2%),  nevada  (-4%),  and  new 
mexico (-4%) (table 4).  within states, decline was not as steady as it was nationally.  for

table 5 declined from 2010 to 2014, but other areas showed small increases. as noted, 
the population from mexico declined by 9 percent. the largest declines, by area, were for 
the caribbean (-9%), south america (-22%), europe (-18%), and oceania (-10%). the 
population from central america increased by 5 percent. populations from africa and asia 
showed smaller increases, of 3 percent and 1 percent, respectively.
sixteen of the countries shown in table 5 lost undocumented population from 2010 to 2014, 
and the population from 10 countries increased. in addition to mexico, the five countries 
(four of them in south america) that declined the most were brazil (-47,000), ecuador 
(-41,000), colombia (-38,000), korea (-37,000), and peru (-24,000). the population from 
four countries grew by 20,000 or more from 2010 to 2014: honduras (36,000), guatemala 
(32,000), india (26,000), and china (21,000) (table 5, column 6).

an examination of the estimates for three countries that had large declines in population 
from 2010 to 2014 showed the following: 

  the total undocumented population from poland fell from 93,000 in 2010 to 57,000 

in 2014, a drop of 38 percent (table 5). the undocumented polish population fell 
by about 19,000 (46%) in illinois and by 16,000 in the new york-new jersey-
connecticut area.

  the total undocumented population from brazil fell by a third from 2010 to 2014, 

from 142,000 to 95,000 (table 5). the largest percent declines were in massachusetts 
(-52%), florida (-41%), and new jersey (-38%). 

  from 2010 to 2014, the total undocumented population from colombia declined by 
38,000 (23%); in florida alone, the population from colombia fell by 25,000 (38%).  

mexicos share of the population

in  preparing  the  estimates  presented  in  this  report,  cms  first  estimated  the  number  of 
undocumented residents who were counted in the 2014 acs. for mexico, that number is 
5.6 million, which is about 55 percent of the 10.2 million undocumented residents counted 
in the 2014 acs (table 6). mexicos percentage of the total undocumented population 
counted in 2014 is the same as mexicos share of undocumented residents  55 percent  
counted in the 1980 census (warren and passel 1987). 
during the 1980 to 2014 period, mexicos share of the total naturalized population doubled 
from 8 percent to 16 percent (table 6). during the same period, the percentage of legally 
resident noncitizens from mexico also doubled, from 12 to 24 percent (table 6, column 3).  
as a result of these increases in the number of legal immigrants from mexico from 1980 
to 2014, the foreign-born population from mexico increased from 17 to 28 percent of the 
total foreign-born population. 

11

us undocumented populationas shown in table 6, the total number of legal residents6 from mexico increased from 
1,062,000 in 1980 to 6,070,000 in 2014. at the same time, the count of undocumented 
residents from mexico increased from 1,131,000 to 5,640,000. thus, over this 34-year 
period, the legally resident population increased by 5.0 million while the undocumented 
population increased by 4.5 million. in summary, from 1980 to 2014 mexicos percentage 
of the legally resident population doubled while its share of the undocumented population 
remained unchanged.

conclusion 
this paper reports that the us undocumented population decreased each year from 2009 
to 2014, including during the period of economic recovery after the great recession. 
the undocumented mexican population continued to decline; it has fallen by more than 
600,000 since 2010. 
diverse  commentators  will  speculate  on  why  these  trends  have  occurred,  what  they 
portend for the vitality and well-being of the nation, and whether they lend support to 
status quo policies, more intensive enforcement, or other changes in immigration policy. in 
earlier work, the author has argued for a path to legal status for a shrinking undocumented 
population with long tenure and extensive equitable ties in the united states (warren and 
kerwin  2015,  100).  in  any  event,  the  paper  rebuts  claims  of  a  growing  undocumented 
population and speculation that the undocumented population would steeply increase as a

plus legally resident noncitizens.

number of undocumented residents nationally, the growing rate of legally resident foreign-
born  persons  from  some  nations,  and  the  growing  proportion  of  naturalized  citizens  in 
almost every us state  that all sides in the immigration debate should welcome.  

appendix a. data sources and methodology
the following is a brief description of the methodology that cms used to derive detailed 
annual estimates of the undocumented population for 2010 to 2014. as table a-1 shows, 
the initial focus was on the estimates for 2010; the procedures used to derive the estimates 
for each year after that are straightforward. 
the  estimation  began  with  the  reported  characteristics  of  non-us  citizens  (henceforth, 
noncitizens) in the micro data of the acs in 2010. for the estimation procedure, the three 
relevant data items from the survey are country of birth, citizenship, and year of entry. 
noncitizens who entered the united states before 1982 are excluded because (1) pre-1982 
entrants could have legalized under the immigration reform and control act of 1986 and 
(2) those who did not do so have had about 30 years in which to leave the undocumented 
resident population.7 
the methodology involved three major steps: (1) applying a series of edits, referred to 
here as logical edits,8 to identify as many legal residents as possible based on responses 
in the survey; (2) deriving separate population controls, for 145 countries or areas, for 
undocumented residents in 2010; and (3) using those population controls to make final 
selections of individual respondents in the acs to be classified as undocumented residents. 
table  a-1  shows  the  specific  steps  followed  to  select  sample  data  for  undocumented 
immigrants from brazil who were counted in the acs each year from 2010 to 2014. the 
same set of procedures were followed for each of the 145 countries or areas. a more detailed 
description of the data sources and methods is available in warren (2014).
the final step in the methodology was to adjust the estimates for under-enumeration. the 
most recent entrants were assumed to have the highest undercount rates (about 12%), and 
the undercount rate drops steadily with length of residence, falling to 2 percent for those who 
entered in 1982. the estimated undercount rate for the entire population is approximately 
7.5 percent.

7   undocumented residents can leave that population in four ways  they can adjust to legal status, be 
removed from the united states, leave the united states voluntarily, or die.
8   the term logical edit refers to the process of determining probable legal status by examining survey data; 
respondents were assigned to the legal category if they worked in occupations that generally require legal 
status, were legal temporary migrants, were immediate relatives of us citizens, received public benefits, such 
as medicare and (in some cases) medicaid, were from countries where most arrivals would be refugees, or 
were age 60 or older at entry. this method was developed by passel and clark (1998), extended by passel, 
van hook and bean (2004), and refined by passel and others in recent years at the pew hispanic center.
