leveraging the world cup: mega 
sporting events, human rights 
risk, and worker welfare reform 
in qatar

sarath k. ganji 
us fulbright scholar

executive summary
qatar  will  realize  its  decades-long  drive  to  host  a  mega  sporting  event 
when,  in  2022,  the  opening  ceremony  of  the  fdration  internationale 
de football association (fifa) world cup commences. by that time, the 
qatari government will have invested at least $200 billion in real estate 
and  development  projects,  employing  anywhere  between  500,000  and 
1.5  million  foreign  workers  to  do  so.  the  scale  of  these  preparations  is 
staggering  and not necessarily positive. between 2010 and 2013, more 
than 1,200 labor migrants working in qatars construction sector died, with 
another 4,000 deaths projected by the start of the event. foreign workers 
are subject to conditions of forced labor, human trafficking, and indefinite 
detention. advocacy groups cite deplorable living and working conditions, 
coupled with lax legal protections for workers, as the main culprits. absent 
significant  improvements  in  worker  welfare,  qatars  world  cup  will  be 
remembered as a human rights tragedy.
this  article  examines  whether  it  is  possible  for  qatars  world  cup  to 
forge a different legacy, as an agent of change on behalf of worker welfare 
reform. in examining the issue, the article takes a two-fold approach. first, 
it locates the policy problem of worker welfare abuses in the context of 
the migration life cycle. the migration life cycle represents the range of 
activities that mediate the relationship between an individual migrant and 
the labor migration system  from the time the migrant first considers 
working overseas to his employment abroad to his eventual return to the 
home country. an understanding of worker welfare abuses in qatar does 
not begin or end with reports of migrant deaths. a much broader pattern 
of abuse exists that, if ignored, will undermine effective policy responses. 
second,  the  article  frames  worker  welfare  as  a  matter  that  lies  at  the 
intersection  of  business  and  human  rights.  mega  events  are  large-
scale,  internationally  recognized  activities  that  aim  to  promote  regional 
development  and  to  advance  universal  values  and  principles.  they  also 
represent an important collaboration between stakeholders across sectors. 
the  un  guiding  principles  on  business  and  human  rights,  therefore, 

 2016 by the center for migration studies of new york. all rights reserved.jmhs volume 4 number 4 (2016): 221-259offer a framework for understanding how worker welfare reform might be 
in the interests of governmental and corporate actors alike. 
ultimately,  this  paper  outlines  four  policy  proposals  that  may  be 
undertaken  by  countries  of  origin,  nongovernmental  organizations, 
international organizations, and qatari employers: (1) the development of 
a list of labor-supply agencies committed to ethical recruitment practices; 
(2) the devising of low-interest, preferential loans for migrants considering 
employment in qatar; (3) the establishment of a resource center to serve as 
a one-stop shop for migrant information and services; and (4) the creation 
of training programs to aid migrants upon their return home. these options 
are not meant to diminish the role of the qatari government in reform 
efforts, and indeed, the state can  and should  take steps to improve 
worker welfare, including strengthening worker welfare standards, closing 
labor law loopholes, and bolstering law enforcement capacity. but these 
measures are not enough. therefore, the above four policy proposals put 
forward a process-specific, rather than actor-specific, approach to reform 
aimed  at  capitalizing  on  the  spotlight  of  the  world  cup  to  bring  about 
lasting, positive change in qatars migrant labor practices. 

i. introduction
the announcement in late 2010 by the fdration internationale de football association 
(fifa) to award qatar  and the arab world  its first world cup was a seminal moment. 
it represented the culmination of decades of political and economic development that had 
positioned qatar as a consequential geopolitical actor. 
in the years ahead, qatar will undertake infrastructure development on an unprecedented 
scale. world cup competitions will take place in at least eight stadiums, most of them newly 
constructed for these specific games. additionally, creation of a team base camp (tbc) 
village for the athletes, as well as lodging, leisure, sport, recreation, and tourism venues 
for the spectators, will be necessary. plans are also underway to create a new airport, a rail 
network, and a metro system (gibson 2012). in all, qatar is expected to invest over $200 
billion in real estate and infrastructure projects (menary 2015). these projects will require 
between 500,000 and 1.5 million foreign workers (zegrea and choufany 2012). 
much  of  qatars  development  has  rested  on  the  efforts  of  these  migrants,  imported 
primarily  from  south asia  and  the  middle  east,  to  fill  its  expanding  construction  and 
domestic worker sectors. two years after fifas announcement, qatar became the object 
of international criticism for the poor conditions in which its labor migrants live and work. 
between 2010 and 2013, more than 1,200 labor migrants working in qatars construction 
sector died, with another 4,000 deaths projected by the start of the world cup event in 
2022 (chen 2015). not all of these deaths have occurred on world cup sites, nor is it 
clear, given state restrictions on post-mortem data, the extent to which these figures can 
be attributed to construction-related incidents (dla piper 2014). what is clear, however, 
is that foreign workers are subject to conditions of forced labor, human trafficking, and 

222

journal on migration and human securityindefinite detention, and that, absent significant improvements in worker welfare, qatars 
world cup will be remembered as a human rights tragedy.
what are the prospects for worker welfare reform in qatar, given the prevailing tensions 
underlying  the  governments  development  objectives  and  its  human  rights  obligations? 
and in what ways does the world cup offer reform advocates an opportunity to balance 
these competing interests, positioning the world cup as an agent of change?  
to  answer  these  questions,  this  paper  focuses  its  analysis  on  migrants  from  the  qatar-
asia  migration  corridor  who  ultimately  take  up  employment  in  qatars  construction 
sector. limiting this papers scope to the above qualifications is appropriate for a couple 
of reasons. first, the qatar-asia migration corridor accounts for over 65 percent of qatars 
total migrant population (table 1; snoj 2014). more importantly, six countries  india, 
nepal,  the  philippines,  sri  lanka,  bangladesh,  and  pakistan    are  disproportionately 
represented in qatars construction and domestic worker sectors, where welfare abuses 
are most common. as such, this article defines the qatar-asia migration corridor in terms 
of  one  country  of  destination  (cod),  qatar,  and  these  six  countries  of  origin  (coos), 
referring to this regional grouping as the qatar-coo migration corridor.

second,  construction,  more  than  any  other  sector,  is  expected  to  experience  a  surge  in 
foreign workers. migrant construction workers face unique welfare abuses due to the extent 
of contracting and subcontracting services typically embedded in construction projects. 
adding such complexity to these value chains increases the probability, magnitude, and 
intensity  of  welfare  abuses  experienced  by  this  subset  of  the  labor  migrant  population 
(ruggie  2013). additionally,  with  the  construction  sector  almost  entirely  composed  of 
males, focusing on this demographic allows for a more tailored analysis. domestic workers,

leveraging the world cupmany of whom are women, face a number of welfare abuses overwhelmingly proportioned 
to their gender, such as sex trafficking. at its current length, this article cannot do justice 
to such abuses.
the findings of this article are based on qualitative evidence drawn from three sources. at 
the outset, a documentary review was undertaken spanning the online and print literatures 
concerning labor migration, business and human rights, and mega events. complementing 
this  review  were  interviews  with  18  leaders  from  think  tanks  and  advocacy  groups, 
governmental bodies, intergovernmental organizations, and corporations. a final source 
comes from fieldwork conducted in qatar, during which visits to construction sites and labor 
camps as well as interviews with 15 camp residents provided supplemental perspectives.
the  remainder  of  this  article  is  organized  into  three  sections. the  first  section  defines 
the policy problem  namely, the factors that make possible worker welfare abuses in 
qatars construction sector  before introducing the concept of the migration life cycle to 
frame the array of abuses experienced by labor migrants across the qatar-coo migration 
corridor. the next section explores the ways in which the world cup can serve as a vehicle 
for political change when approached through the un guiding principles on business and 
human rights. the final section lays out potential recommendations directed at a range of 
stakeholders invested in qatars policies on migration and development. 

ii. worker welfare
the qatari states long-term objective is to transform the small gulf nation into an advanced 
country. as articulated in national vision 2030  a qatari development plan launched in 
2008  the state plans to achieve this objective through investments in human, social, 
economic,  and  environmental  development  (qatar  mdps  2008). at  the  heart  of  these 
efforts is the recognition that the countrys rapid growth must not outpace its capabilities 
and that its development is largely dependent upon the size and quality of its migrant labor 
force. at times, however, development as a national interest is at odds with worker welfare 
as an ethical imperative. 
this tension is on display in qatars preparations for world cup 2022. hence, the central 
policy challenge is to improve worker welfare by addressing existing abuses endemic to 
the migration life cycle linking qatar to coos. 

a. elements of the problem

the number of foreign workers migrating to the arabian gulf places it among the worlds 
three most active destinations for labor migrants (gardner 2012). in all, nearly 25 million 
expatriates  are  employed  in  gulf  cooperation  council  (gcc)  countries,  a  figure  that 
constitutes almost half of the total gcc population (table 2). 
of course, this population imbalance is hardly new. since the oil boom of the 1970s, gulf 
states have relied on foreign workers, drawn primarily from arab and asian countries, 
to channel oil wealth into ambitious economic development projects. over this period, 
however, gulf states increasingly began to focus their short-term hiring on labor migrants 

224

migrants were more likely to settle permanently and were more prone to engage in political 
dissent over perceived unfair labor practices (fargues 2011).

today, labor migration and worker welfare standards exist in a complex system that props 
up the overall architecture of the migration life cycle linking qatar to coos. the benefits 
and  costs  of  labor  migration  are  a  function  of  this  complex  system.  four  elements,  in 
particular, frame the push-pull factors driving this system. 

1.  demographic element

the limited pool of nationals available in cods has put pressure on gulf states to import 
labor from abroad. in qatar, the expatriate population is roughly six times the size of the 
national  population  (glmm  2015;  qatar  mdps  2016).  furthermore,  according  to  the 
qatar statistics authority, 94 percent of the countrys working population are expatriates 
(report: qatar growing 2012). if existing demographic trends are permitted to continue, 
qatar  will  become  younger,  more  male,  more  foreign,  and  more  concentrated  in  the 
countrys urban centers of doha and al rayyan (chalabi 2013; report: most nationals 
2013).
several factors underlie these demographic trends. the first, as described above, is the lofty 
goals that animate the qatari states development strategy. these goals, particularly the 

225

leveraging the world cupinfrastructure planning now driving world cup preparations, necessitate the importation 
of foreign workers, despite state recognition of the demographic challenges such actions 
invite. a  second  and  closely  related  factor  is  the  uneven  implementation  of  workforce 
nationalization, often referred to as qatarization. as the gcc states pursue nationalization 
policies with varying degrees of success, qatar faces an uncompetitive national labor market 
in which 96 percent of nationals work in the public or mixed public and private sectors and 
in which demand for skilled national workers outpaces supply (randeree 2012).

2.  economic element

citizens of coos often view temporary jobs in the gulf as lucrative opportunities to earn 
higher wages than would be possible in their home countries. and with the savings generated 
by these higher wages, labor migrants typically remit sizable portions of their earnings 
back to their families living in coos. according to the center for global development, 
in 2011 expatriates working in gcc countries remitted $75 billion to their home countries 
(clemens 2013). in qatar alone, remittance outflows in 2009 totaled roughly $9 billion, with 
just under half of that figure going to asian countries (endo and afram 2011). moreover, 
the impact of these remittance flows, in terms of economic growth and poverty reduction, 
can  be  tremendous:  remittances  from  nepali  workers  in  qatar  amounted  to  over  $600 
million, or 5 percent of nepals gdp, in 2009 (endo and afram 2011).
driving  these  economic  gains  abroad  are  economic  shortcomings  at  home.  often,  the 
labor markets of coos are marked by an oversupply of labor and, therefore, staggering 
unemployment. nepal, for example, suffers from widespread unemployment and poverty, 
motivating nepali workers to seek job opportunities in the gulf (amnesty international 
2011). it is precisely because of such high unemployment that some coo states, like the 
philippines in the 1970s, institutionalized labor migration as a potential remedy to their 
countries economic stagnation (oneil 2004). the condition of coo labor markets  and 
the capacity of coo governments to affect them  has much to do with pushing labor 
migrants to seek jobs in the gulf.    

3.  political element 

the relationships between coos and cods, as well as those among coos, have a bearing 
on  the  migration life  cycle. as  martin  (2012)  notes,  many  worker  welfare  abuses  take 
place beyond the reach of coos, requiring active collaboration on the part of cods. there 
also exists a power imbalance accompanying coo-cod interactions. this imbalance is 
evident, for example, in a 2013 incident tainting qatar-nepal relations. notably, nepal 
recalled  maya  kumari  sharma,  its  ambassador  to  qatar,  following  the  publication  of 
her remarks in a guardian article that compared qatar to an open jail (sharma 2013). 
days later, in a joint press conference held by nepali and qatari officials, nepali official 
mohammed ramadan spoke of his countrys labor migrants as safe and fully respected 
in qatar (doherty and bakr 2013). nepal, in other words, took a deferential position to the 
qatari state, rather than seizing upon the momentum for reform of a system that exploits 
its nationals.  

226

journal on migration and human securitynepals decision to distance itself from sharmas comments can also be attributed to the 
relationships among coos  relationships that are at times competitive. the magnitude 
of remittance flows, and the broader economic interests at stake, may incentivize coos 
to forego additional worker welfare protections or relax existing protections to increase 
their share of workers in gcc labor markets (shaham 2008; ilo 2010). worker welfare 
protections in the philippines and indonesia, for example, prompted saudi arabia to freeze 
its hiring of domestic workers from either country. capitalizing on the opportunity, nepal 
lifted its ban on domestic workers to gcc countries (ecosoc 2013). 

4.  legal element

current worker welfare protections governing the gulf-asia migration corridor exist in a 
complex web of legal norms that are unevenly recognized and enforced by coos and cods. 
for the qatar-coo corridor, in particular, the legal norms regulating worker welfare can be 
organized into three layers. the first layer represents legal norms codified in international 
law that might be said to define universal principles, whether or not a state has ratified 
the law (abbott et al. 2000). this layer includes instruments as general as the universal 
declaration of human rights (udhr) and as specific as the migrant-related conventions 
of the international labor organization (ilo). to be sure, the enforceability and efficacy of 
these instruments are not a given. the second layer entails bilateral agreements with coos 
that are more specific to the migration life cycle linking qatar to a coo. the enforceability 
and  efficacy  of  these  agreements,  however,  are  also  uncertain,  especially  as  they  often 
apply across less than the full migration life cycle (zahra 2013; battistella and khadria 
2011). the final layer of legal norms is composed of domestic laws, in particular law no. 
14 of 2004 regulating employment (labor law), law no. 4 of 2009 regulating the 
entry, exit, residence, and sponsorship of expatriates (sponsorship law), and law no. 
15 of 2011 combatting trafficking in human beings (zahra 2013). these laws  soon to 
be joined by law no. 21 of 2015 regulating the entry, exit, and residence of expatriates 
(law no. 21), which became effective in december 2016  define a range of worker 
welfare  protections  that  are  required  of  employers  in  qatar  that  hire  either  national  or 
expatriate workers.
in spite of these norms and regulations, a number of limitations remain. first, qatar and 
its main coos have not ratified the same instruments of international law. such uneven 
adoption makes it difficult to follow and enforce common standards (martin 2012). second, 
to the extent facially useful law exists, both qatar and coos often lack the capacity or 
motivation to enforce it. qatars domestic laws, therefore, will continue to insufficiently 
address worker welfare abuses (hrw 2012).

b. migration life cycle 

push-pull factors demonstrate the value of labor migration as a development tool for both 
qatar and coos. amid these benefits, however, are abuses that often characterize the labor 
migrant experience. here, the term abuse encompasses a range of conditions, from human 
rights violations in contravention of national and international laws, to poor living and 

227

leveraging the world cupworking standards that run counter to widely shared norms, to structural impediments, 
like misinformation, that expose labor migrants to unfavorable circumstances. remedying 
these abuses, and the conditions that make them possible, is central to any effort to improve 
worker welfare.

a useful way to frame these abuses is in terms of the migration life cycle. the migration life 
cycle represents the range of activities that mediate the relationship between an individual 
migrant and the labor migration system from the time the migrant first considers working 
overseas to his or her employment abroad and eventual return to the home country. this 

229

leveraging the world cupcycle consists of four phases: recruitment, deployment, employment, and return (table 3). 
worker welfare abuses may occur at any phase of the migration life cycle. some abuses occur 
within a particular phase, while others span multiple phases or, alternatively, contribute to 
abuses in other phases. using this frame, therefore, adds clarity to an otherwise complex 
set  of  abuses  and,  as  is  discussed  later,  offers  multiple  points  for  policy  intervention. 
additionally, this approach improves upon past approaches to worker welfare reform by 
examining the transnational and systemic nature of abuses rather than fixating on particular 
actors  for example, governments or corporations  or phases.

1.  recruitment phase

the migration life cycle begins with the recruitment phase, during which a contracting 
or subcontracting firm operating in qatar decides to fill an opening using a non-qatari 
worker. firms  which typically work on behalf of a much larger client, such as the qatar 
foundation, qatar rail, or msheireb properties  first seek authorization from the qatari 
ministry of labor and social affairs (mlsa) to hire a certain number of workers from a 
particular country. after receiving authorization, firms subcontract the hiring process to a 
private recruitment agency, often referred to as a private employment agency (pea). these 
peas are qatari firms licensed by the mlsa and hired for the purposes of identifying 
foreign workers and shuttling them through the visa process in their home countries (endo 
and afram 2011). 
from here, peas use coo-based recruiters called manpower agencies to identify aspiring 
labor migrants. aspiring migrants are migrants who have an interest in seeking employment 
in qatar but have not yet begun the process of obtaining a work visa from their home 
governments. while manpower agencies are tasked with locating, processing, and aiding 
aspiring migrants with the visa authorization process, many rely on labor brokers to locate 
aspiring migrants at the village level (endo and afram 2011).
firms operating in qatar often initiate the labor migration process in light of their clients 
outsized construction projects and high demand for foreign workers. alternatively, citizens 
of coos who actively seek work opportunities in qatar can initiate the process, though 
this occurs along a different pathway. social networks, travel agencies, and government-
to-government agreements are all options available to aspiring migrants hoping to secure 
a work visa, though the exact nature of each varies among coos (migrant forum in asia 
2011).  many  aspiring  migrants,  however,  go  through  manpower  agencies,  with  labor 
brokers as their primary points of contact. in this case, manpower agencies pool the names 
of aspiring migrants and give them to peas when a request for foreign workers is received. 

2.  deployment phase

once  the  aspiring  migrant  commits  to  the  visa  authorization  process,  he  becomes  a 
deploying  migrant  and  the  deployment  phase  begins.  though  visa  authorization  was 
already given by qatars mlsa, the migrant must also obtain authorization from his home 
countrys relevant ministry, usually the labor ministry. this additional layer of oversight is 
the result of bilateral labor agreements concluded between qatar and its main coos and

leveraging the world cuprequires  that  both  countries  manage  the  migration  process  (table  4;  endo  and 
afram  2011).  in  turn,  labor  migrants  are  responsible  for  securing  all  necessary  legal 
documents,  including  passports,  visas,  and  foreign  employment  permits.  from  there, 
the  process  varies  considerably  across  coos.  deploying  migrants,  for  example,  may 
be  required  to  participate  in  an  interview  with  their  home  countrys  relevant  ministry, 
during  which  time  they  sign  an  employment  contract. additionally,  they  may  undergo 
a  pre-departure  medical  exam  and  take  part  in  a  government-mandated  briefing 
outlining  their  rights  and  responsibilities  in  the  cod  (amnesty  international  2011).
the visa authorization process is complicated and time-intensive, and as a result, most 
deploying migrants turn to labor brokers as a source of logistical support. brokers, in turn, 
become responsible for preparing legal documents and updating deploying migrants on the 
status of their applications. in some cases, brokers even accompany deploying migrants to 
their interviews, medical exams, and pre-departure briefings (amnesty international 2011).
as this process unfolds in the coo, a parallel process takes place in qatar. the qatari 
pea is responsible for collecting passport copies and signed employment contracts from 
aspiring migrants and submitting them to the mlsa, after which the ministry of interior 
issues their work visas. the contracts and job openings are also screened by the coo 
embassies based in doha as well as the qatari chamber of commerce and its ministry of 
foreign affairs. only after these screenings are complete can the relevant coo ministries 
authorize the departure of deploying migrants, which comes in the form of a sticker placed 
in migrants passports (endo and afram 2011). at this point, deploying migrants are given 
an offer letter by the pea along with a contract stipulating the terms of the job in qatar. 

3.  employment phase

upon arrival in qatar, current migrants begin the employment phase during which they 
are legally subject to qatari immigration laws  in particular, the 2004 labor law and 
the 2009 sponsorship law. the labor law includes a number of provisions regulating the 
recruitment and employment of foreign workers  from setting workplace standards for 
weekly hours and paid leave to mandating health and safety measures to safeguard against 
occupational hazards (hrw 2013). the sponsorship law, meanwhile, requires that current 
migrants  have  at  all  times  a  sponsor,  oftentimes  their  employer,  who  assumes  legal 
responsibility for their stay while in qatar. the notion of sponsorship is at the heart of the 
kafala system: a set of traditions, derived from the bedouin principle of hospitality, which 
arab states have long used to manage guest workers (khan and harroff-tavel 2011). the 
sponsorship law, as such, enshrines some of these traditions in law by holding sponsors 
legally responsible for current migrants entry into and exit from qatar, and by requiring 
them to provide migrants with residence permits (hrw 2013). in practice, this means that 
current migrants may change employers only if their sponsors consent, and that migrants 
can leave the country only by obtaining an exit visa through their sponsors.

4.  return phase

upon completing their contractual work period and obtaining an exit visa, current migrants 
enter the return phase of the migration life cycle, becoming returning migrants who must 

232

journal on migration and human securityreintegrate economically and socially into their home countries. here, coo policies diverge 
considerably, with some countries, like the philippines, providing substantial reintegration 
services, such as loans for migrants to begin small businesses, while other countries offer 
very little (go 2012). the cyclical nature of the migration life cycle means that these same 
returning migrants may take up opportunities within their home countries or reengage with 
the labor migration process, once again becoming aspiring migrants.

c. worker welfare abuses

at various points in the migration life cycle, labor migrants are exposed to abuses that 
make possible the conditions of forced labor, human trafficking, and indefinite detention 
that are commonly referenced by media and human rights groups. these abuses, in part, 
are a function of deviations from the ideal process of labor migration described above. of 
course, these abuses are also the result of inadequate or poorly enforced laws in both qatar 
and coos. as shown in table 4, a number of factors  some resulting from structural 
factors, others from diverging stakeholder interests  conspire to create these abuses.

1.  recruitment abuses

during  the  recruitment phase  of  the  life  cycle,  two  abuses  are  common.  one  potential 
abuse results from the corruption that often accompanies the management and distribution 
of visas. according to a labor migration specialist at the ilo (personal communication 
2014), with manpower agencies in coos relying so heavily on labor brokers to identify 
and to process aspiring migrants, a type of auction occurs: labor brokers bid on the right 
to secure a work visa, permitting manpower agencies  and the qatari peas that contract 
with them  to pocket substantial sums prior to doing any work. this amount is later 
passed on as debt to the aspiring migrant to whom the visa is given, contributing to the 
debt burden that many labor migrants take on well before ever arriving in qatar (amnesty 
international 2011).
such outcomes are unsurprising, given how little regulation exists at the broker level. in 
nepal, for example, over 1,000 manpower agencies, all based in kathmandu, were licensed 
to recruit in 2005. at the time, these agencies relied on some 25,000 to 30,000 brokers 
operating across the country (verite 2012). yet, as of 2013, only 500 brokers had actually 
registered  with  the  department  of  foreign  employment,  nepals  regulatory  authority 
(kern and muller-boker 2015). as a result, brokers are able to charge recruitment fees, 
well above the legal limit, to aspiring migrants without fear of legal punishment. these 
fees are in addition to the commissions that brokers receive from manpower agencies for 
providing them with the names of aspiring migrants (migrant forum in asia 2011).
a  second  potential  abuse  is  the  bevy  of  misinformation  given  to  aspiring  migrants 
considering employment in qatar. two key sources of misinformation are labor brokers 
and returning migrants. labor brokers, in the eyes of many aspiring migrants, are a trusted 
source for information on which cods are best, which sectors are most lucrative, and 
what steps are needed to secure a work visa. brokers operate at the village level, often 
knowing the aspiring migrant or his family well, and sometimes knowing, too, the cod 

233

leveraging the world cupfrom personal experience (asfar 2009; amnesty international 2011). yet, because brokers 
income is dependent upon their ability to connect a job opening to an aspiring migrant, 
their incentive to provide false information about the cod and the available job is high. 
similarly, returning labor migrants who have just completed their temporary assignment 
in  the  cod  often  propagate,  unknowingly  or  intentionally,  inaccurate  information.  a 
demographer with extensive research experience on labor migrants in the gulf (personal 
communication  2014)  noted  that  some  returning  migrants  exhibit  an  observable 
improvement in their standard of living, giving aspiring migrants the impression of cods 
with gold in the street. other returnees, however, have been the victims of forced labor 
and would rather misrepresent their experiences abroad than admit their failure to family 
and friends (asfar 2009). aspiring migrants, in turn, are drawn to an image of qatar that 
has little basis in reality.

2.  deployment abuses

the deployment phase also carries with it a number of abuses. one set of abuses results 
from the labor brokers themselves. in light of the services they offer and the fees they 
charge, brokers often assist migrants, most of whom have limited financial means, with 
procuring loans. these loans, however, come with high interest rates, some as high as 36 
percent, thus giving migrants little chance of paying off their debt even in the event that 
their qatari job provides a reasonable wage (amnesty international 2013; jureidini 2014). 
additionally, before deploying migrants can depart their home countries for qatar, they 
must have in hand a demand letter, which is similar to an employment agreement, describing 
the initial offer. here, as one recruitment agency project manager (personal communication 
2014) observed, manpower agencies and brokers will have deploying migrants pay a fee 
to receive their demand letters. this exchange occurs despite laws in qatar prohibiting 
migrants from paying such fees as well as laws in coos capping the amount that migrants 
have to pay. a 2011 study by the qatar national human rights committee, for example, 
noted that 53 percent of construction workers randomly surveyed in qatar had paid fees of 
some sort (amnesty international 2013). in addition to these factors, there exists an urban-
rural divide that leads many migrants to take out additional loans to finance their travel to 
and stay in state capitals where key parts of the visa authorization process take place. 
as  a  result,  deploying  migrants  accrue  considerable  debt.  according  to  one  report, 
bangladeshi migrants on average accrued just under $2,500 usd and nepalese migrants 
approximately $1,200 usd of debt (agunias 2012). these figures do not include interest 
rates attached to the repayment of these sums. absent other sources of income, the jobs 
awaiting  these  migrants  in  qatar,  however  much  they  stray  from  stated  expectations, 
become their only means of paying down a growing debt burden. these circumstances trap 
migrants into a type of forced labor. 
a similar trap is created by the widely reported problem of false or substitution contracts. 
false  contracts  are  contracts  that  contain  false  information,  such  as  inflated  salaries  or 
inaccurate  job  placements,  but  are  nonetheless  distributed  to  deploying  migrants  by 
brokers and manpower agencies (yeager 2008). substitution contracts, on the other hand, 

234

journal on migration and human securityare entirely new contracts with new terms that are given to migrants upon arrival to qatar. 
these contracts are often quite different in the salary, benefits, and even work industries 
stipulated  in  the  original  contract.  in  both  cases,  brokers  and  manpower  agencies  use 
these tactics to circumvent  as is the case of nepal  laws that require the cod job to 
pay a minimum wage or provide particular benefits to the deploying migrant (amnesty 
international 2013). as such, that migrants are being transported overseas on the basis of 
deceptive or fraudulent claims  and subsequently being exploited for their labor once in 
qatar  indicates the presence of human trafficking. 
also  a  problem  during  the  deployment  phase  is  the  quality  of  pre-departure  training. 
according to a demography expert familiar with labor migration across the qatar-coo 
corridor (personal communication 2014), the mandatory trainings held in coos just prior 
to  their  departure  are  largely  superficial  and  provide  aspiring  migrants  with  very  little 
information about qatars legal environment or the resources available to labor migrants. 
as amnesty international (2013) observed in nepal, as of 2011 there were 57 companies 
authorized to conduct pre-departure briefings, but random surveys of returning migrants 
revealed that some migrants had not known that pre-departure briefings existed, let alone 
were mandatory, while still others had simply skipped them, owing to poor monitoring by 
the government and intermediaries. the result has been that migrants, upon arrival in qatar, 
know very little about their rights, the ways in which those rights might be threatened, and 
the resources available to seek a remedy.  

3.  employment abuses

over the past decade, abuses occurring during the employment phase  more so than any 
other phase  have caught the attention of states, intergovernmental organizations, and 
media and human rights groups calling for worker welfare reform. these abuses have been 
well-documented in recent reports by human rights watch (2013), amnesty international 
(2013 and 2016), the international trade union confederation (2014), and the international 
labor organization (2016). at the heart of these abuses is the tension between the kafala 
system and qatars 2004 labor law. azfar khan, a labor migration specialist with the ilo, 
states that the aim of the labor law was to balance the rights and obligations of employers 
and employees. instead, he argues, that balance  and the legal enforcement of it  has 
been hampered by qatars continued reliance on the kafala system, which puts far too 
much power in the hands of the employer/sponsor (khan 2014). 
as  a  result,  current  migrants  face  deplorable  working  and  living  conditions.  in  the 
construction sector, migrants may be forced to work well over 60 hours per week, be given 
an inadequate supply of water in 100-plus degree weather, be unnecessarily exposed to 
occupational hazards, and fail to receive the full regular or overtime wages due to them 
(amnesty international 2013). 
their living conditions, meanwhile, are equally troubling. sponsors often place construction 
workers in labor camps located on the outskirts of qatari cities. these accommodations 
typically fit as many as 10 to 15 workers in a single room consisting of bunk beds and stone 
floors. occupants have no privacy, must sometimes endure missing or non-functioning air 
conditioners, and in certain cases use their rooms as kitchens. in instances where separate 

235

leveraging the world cupkitchens are available, their appearance is substandard. the same holds true for bathrooms, 
which are highly unsanitary. reinforcing these abuses is the employer practice of passport 
confiscation, which, though illegal, routinizes these conditions as a facet of migrant life in 
qatar (amnesty international 2013). these working and living conditions  accompanied 
by local policies that subject construction sector workers to daily discrimination  have 
become the norm for migrants who either find their complaints consistently ignored or who 
fear reprisals from sponsors upon reporting such conditions.
abuses of these types can cause migrants to leave their jobs without permission. under the 
sponsorship law, sponsors are required to report such events  referred to as absconding 
 to the ministry of interior. absconding can result in migrants being fined, deported, or 
even prosecuted on criminal charges (amnesty international 2013). this is true even in 
instances where current migrants are in fact fleeing situations of abuse or nonpayment. in 
these cases, the investigative process of the ministry of interiors search and follow-up 
department (sfd), which enforces the law in matters of absconding, routinely ignores why 
absconded migrants chose to run away from their sponsors or employers (moi rounds 
2013). 
as runaways, migrants become irregular migrants who operate outside qatari labor laws. 
irregular migrants lack protections afforded to them under the labor law and are all the 
more likely to be drawn into conditions of forced labor, working for employers who can use 
the threat of an absconding report to coerce them into highly exploitative circumstances. 
if found or reported, an irregular migrant may be deported or indefinitely detained until a 
time at which the government has completed the necessary arrangements to deport him. 
in some cases, detention of irregular migrants has lasted as long as a year (crepeau 2013). 
such procedures add an additional layer to current migrants circumstances of forced labor, 
positioning them to take undesirable jobs due to crushing debt and then necessitating their 
stay due to the risks that accompany becoming an irregular migrant.

4.  return abuses

although  acquisition  of  an  exit  visa  may  permit  returning  migrants  to  escape  welfare 
abuses in qatar, they still face another set of abuses upon return to their home countries. 
chief  among  these,  according  to  an  ilo  study  on  returning  sri  lankan  migrants,  are 
barriers  to  economic  and  social  reintegration.  economically,  this  sample  of  returning 
migrants often assumed jobs that were unskilled in character, rarely requiring the use of 
skills acquired while working in the cod. moreover, although 70 percent of the migrants 
had secured a job in their home countries within six months of their return, those jobs 
were of a quality and pay scale that indicated underemployment (ilo 2013b). socially, 
returning migrants reported certain challenges when reintegrating with their families and 
communities, including a decline in the familys economic situation as well as a tendency 
not to form partnerships with or participate in community organizations (ilo 2013b). in 
both instances, migrants have rarely sought out sources of external support to help with the 
reintegration process, an apparent reflection of the limited professional support services 
available to them or a cultural context not conducive to seeking out such services.

236

journal on migration and human securityiii. mega events 
a sentiment commonly expressed by fifa and qatari officials alike is that the 2022 world 
cup will serve as an agent of change in qatar, one that will accelerate the undertaking 
of appropriate labor reforms. thus, qatars world cup chief, hassan al thawadi, called 
the  event  a  catalyst  to  accelerate  positive  initiatives  that  will  result  in  meaningful 
progress for worker welfare (gibson 2014). similarly, theo zwanziger, former member 
of fifas executive committee, called any decision to strip qatar of hosting privileges 
counterproductive,  drawing  attention  away  from  human  rights  violations  that  will 
otherwise still exist (stevis 2014). 
of course, these statements are largely conjecture. it is unclear if a mega event, like the 
world cup, can indeed drive policy concessions in qatar and, if so, along which causal 
pathways. 
to better understand the pathways that might lead to positive labor reform, this article 
presents  a  theory  of  change  organized  around  the  un  guiding  principles  on  business 
and human rights (the principles). the principles, which were endorsed by the un 
human rights council in 2011, aim to enhance standards and practices with regard to 
business and human rights so as to achieve tangible results for affected individuals and 
communities (ruggie 2011). more specifically, they clarify the responsibilities of states 
and  business  enterprises  engaged  in  activities  that  threaten  internationally  recognized 
rights. at their core are three pillars defined, in 2008, by the un protect, respect, and 
remedy framework (ihrb 2011):

1.  the  state  obligation  to  protect  against  human  rights  abuses  committed  by  third 

parties.

2.  the corporate responsibility to respect humans rights by performing due diligence.
3.  the victims access to effective remedy through judicial and non-judicial means.

the principles, on their face, have little to say about migrant rights, only mentioning migrant 
workers in passing as a category of victim potentially in need of additional attention. when 
applied  to world  cup  2022,  however,  the  principles  highlight  the  risks  that  the  qatari 
state and corporations invite in the absence of sufficient rights protections. these risks 
are consequential, primarily because the world cup is a public-private collaboration that 
attracts international attention. state and corporate inattention to worker welfare abuses, 
therefore, is tantamount to a poorly devised risk management strategy. in addition, the 
failure  of  either  sector    public  or  private    to  follow  through  on  its  human  rights 
commitments has implications for the other sector. 

a. duty to protect

the state duty to protect human rights is defined by two foundational principles. the first is 
state protection against human rights abuses within its territory by preventing, investigating, 
punishing, and redressing such abuses (ruggie 2011). reiterating this duty is important in 
a context where private actors, and not necessarily states, are responsible for the brunt of 
rights abuses being committed. even so, by fact of these abuses occurring within states, 
those states become complicit, either directly when such abuses are attributable to them, 

237

leveraging the world cupor indirectly when they fail to take steps to address them. in qatar, ongoing reports of 
worker welfare abuses are linked to corporations  some qatari, others joint venture  
that ultimately shape workers living and working conditions. this foundational principle, 
therefore, locates these corporations and the abuses committed under their watch within the 
purview of state obligation.
a second foundational principle is state recognition that the extraterritorial activities of 
local  companies  may  also  infringe  upon  human  rights  (ruggie  2011).  existing  human 
rights law does not extend state obligation to these activities. as such, states themselves 
are responsible for setting expectations by defining and publicizing the laws and practices 
that local businesses are subject to, even when operating beyond their home countries. for 
qatar, setting expectations is especially important vis--vis recruitment agencies. as qatari 
companies, these agencies engage in business activities abroad that may directly violate or 
indirectly contribute to rights abuses.   
these  two  foundational  principles  give  rise  to  two  areas  in  which  public-private 
collaborations, such as world cup 2022, place pressure on the qatari state to discharge 
its human rights obligations and, in turn, take an active role in improving worker welfare. 
broadly, these areas might be categorized as reputational risks associated with possessing 
a  poor  human  rights  record.  more  specifically,  though,  these  pressure  points  concern 
national competitiveness and security.

1.  national competitiveness

in its annual global competitiveness report, the world economic forum (wef) (2015) 
defines competitiveness as the set of institutions, policies, and factors that determine the 
level of productivity of a country. productivity is based on a number of metrics, but two in 
particular, institutions and labor market efficiency, are relevant to the discussion on world 
cup  2022.  institutions  refer  to  the  legal  and  administrative  framework  that  structures 
interactions among individuals, businesses, and governments (schwab and sala-i-martin 
2015). this framework considers both public and private institutions: public institutions 
in  terms  of  government  efficiency,  levels  of  corruption,  and  susceptibility  to  undue 
influence (among other factors), and private institutions in terms of corporate ethics and 
accountability. labor market efficiency, meanwhile, considers how effectively workers are 
allocated across an economy and whether they are incentivized to be productive (schwab 
and sala-i-martin 2015). the flexibility of the market and the use of talent are thus critical.  
according to wef, qatar is the most competitive economy in the middle east and the 
14th most competitive in the world, owing in large part to the strength of its institutions 
and the presumption of an efficient labor market (scwab and sala-i-martin 2015). failure 
to address worker welfare abuses, therefore, undermines perceptions of qatari institutions 
and, with it, national competitiveness. 
first,  continued  worker  welfare  abuses  demonstrate  the  limited  capacity  of  qatari 
institutions. promoting accountability, legal certainty, and transparency as well as enforcing 
regulations in a consistent and coherent manner  these indicators, according to the un 
guiding principles, are part and parcel of a states duty to protect against rights abuses 
(ruggie 2011). these indicators also reflect a states institutional quality. as such, qatars 

238

journal on migration and human securityinability to maintain its commitments to national and international law, including human 
rights law, suggests a state with limited institutional strength. 
second, the perception of capacity-limited institutions sends the wrong signal to foreign 
companies seeking to do business in qatar. as the guiding principles make clear, states must 
set expectations for whether and how they intend to meet their human rights commitments. 
this is particularly important for businesses that require a certain level of legal certainty 
and regulatory predictability to conduct operations. hence, state uncertainty in this realm 
exposes businesses  at least, those that are human rights-conscious  to unwanted risks 
that might hurt their bottom line. 
this  dynamic  was  apparent  in  january  of  2014  when  verisk  maplecroft,  a  uk-based 
global risk and strategic consulting firm, downgraded qatar to an extreme risk country 
in its working conditions index. the downgrade came in response to the hazardous and 
sometimes deadly conditions facing labor migrants in the construction sector. lizabeth 
campbell, a director at the firm, paired the downgrade with an observation: these disasters 
have  prompted  serious  questions  regarding  corporate  responsibility,  which  have  forced 
this issue high up the risk register for many multinational companies (verisk maplecroft 
2014). this perception, in turn, challenges qatars continued ability to attract the foreign 
firms so critical to executing its development objectives.
third,  qatars  development  objectives  do  not  exist  in  isolation  but,  rather,  are  in 
competition for resources with other gcc countries. dubai, for example, was awarded 
the right to host world expo 2020, another prominent mega event. given the coincidence 
of  dubais  expo  and  qatars world  cup,  as  well  as  both  countries  heavy  reliance  on 
foreign capital for development and foreign workers for manpower, continuation of worker 
welfare abuses in qatar may jeopardize its ability to attract the firms and workers needed 
to complete its ambitious infrastructure projects (kovessy 2013). this is especially true as 
reports of dubais human rights record, according to one migrant worker welfare specialist 
(personal communication 2014), indicate improvements in its labor environment. absent 
improvements in its own reputation, qatar may find it increasingly difficult, over the next 
six years, to make good on its world cup vision.

2.  national security interests

in pursuit of their national interests, states typically exercise power to shape the behavior 
of other actors. some states operationalize their power through bullying, others through 
buying, and still others through persuading (nye 2009). many use a combination of all 
three. how these tactics are used for larger foreign policy ends, according to joseph nye, 
might be described as a states hard power or soft power strategy. hard power, which is 
dependent on a countrys economic and military might, refers to a states ability to coerce 
or buy. soft power, by contrast, concerns a states ability to attract  that is, to achieve 
its interests by persuading other actors to favor those interests as well (nye 2004). both 
strategies have implications for national security, depending on a countrys stock of hard 
and soft power resources as well as its ability to deploy those resources toward particular 
ends. 

239

leveraging the world cupqatars  national  security  strategy,  in  the  eyes  of  many  observers,  is  one  predicated  on 
soft  power.  mehran  kamrava,  an  academic  at  georgetown  universitys  doha  campus, 
describes qatars influence as a subtle power  one that is rooted in a combination of 
contextual opportunities and calculated policies meant to augment its influence over others 
(kemrava 2013). the origins of this strategy lie in the experiences of the small gulf states 
during iraqs 1990 invasion and occupation of kuwait. the event, in the eyes of qataris 
like sheikh hamad bin khalifa al-thani, then the son of the ruling emir (and later, head-of-
state when qatar was named world cup host), demonstrated the countrys vulnerabilities 
 namely, its modest military force and its proximity to the iran-iraq-saudi arabia rivalry. 
the event also showed qataris the importance of securing powerful international partners, 
like the united states, that would support the country in times of crisis (ulrichsen 2012). 
the result was qatars pursuit of a soft power strategy aimed at creating interdependencies 
and cultivating its brand as a modern and peace-loving state  a brand that might earn 
it friends when in need (dorsey 2013). this brand, shadi hamid argues, is critical to 
qatars ability to leave its mark on the regions politics and, in turn, bolster its national 
security (siegal 2013). 
of course, qatars brand  and its broader soft power appeal  rests on several pillars. 
these include its activism in regional diplomacy, its messaging through al jazeera, its 
cultural diffusion via museums, and its research and innovation capacity vis-a-vis education 
city. all of the above, according to collins (2012), is meant to demonstrate a desire to 
balance arab traditions and western modernization. as such, ongoing worker welfare 
abuses are likely to tarnish brand qatar, particularly by undermining its diplomatic pull.
as a 2012 gulf news report details, qatars efforts in the area of conflict mediation are 
considerable and include forging agreements between eritrea and yemen (1996), yemen 
and its houthi rebel movement (2007), rival lebanese factions (2008), sudan and chad 
(2009), and feuding palestinian factions (2012), among others (seale 2012). the breadth 
of qatars diplomatic undertakings, meanwhile, has earned it an extensive and baffling 
diversity  of  friends.  these  include  security  ties  with  the  united  states,  commercial 
activities  with  iran,  a  nascent  diplomatic  dialogue  with  israel,  and  cozy  relations  with 
islamist groups like hamas and the muslim brotherhood (collins 2012). 
but reports of continued worker welfare abuses, including the deaths of hundreds of indian 
and nepali workers, threaten to undermine qatars influence in the diplomatic realm. one 
threat comes from worsening relations with members of the european parliament  the 
legislative body of the european union  that has been critical of the pace of qatari labor 
reforms. over the span of five months, the body passed an emergency resolution condemning 
the abuse of construction workers, held a hearing during which parliamentarians spoke 
of the need to reform the kafala system, and soon after sent a delegation to meet with 
qatari authorities and push for substantial reform of existing sponsorship laws (european 
parliament 2013; khatri 2014; kovessy 2014a; european parliament 2014). 
a second threat arises from the impact of worker welfare abuses on qatars foreign policy 
priorities  that is, the qatari states unexpected need to shift attention away from regional 
matters and onto its human rights record. qatars once dominant role in the region has given 

240

journal on migration and human securityway to a string of failures  egypt, libya, and syria chief among them.1 compounding 
these failures was the decision by saudi arabia, bahrain, and the united arab emirates 
(uae),  in  2014,  to  withdraw  their  ambassadors  from  doha  in  response  to  perceived 
qatari meddling in their internal affairs (dickinson 2014). diplomatic relations were later 
restored. initially, however, rather than mending these relationships or resurrecting its role 
as regional mediator, the qatari state focused its energies on recasting its human rights 
image. this was evident in emir sheikh tamim bin hamad al thanis decision, in february 
2014, to restructure the qatar 2022 supreme committee by replacing its board of directors 
with members of his own cabinet while he stayed on as chair (dorsey 2014; scott 2014). as 
a result, the small gulf state increasingly ceded ground to saudi arabia, which, according 
to political analyst ayed al manna, regained its role in regional politics (agence-france 
presse 2014).
a third threat is the possibility of ongoing rights abuses creating a negative legacy for 
world cup 2022  and what that could mean for qatars sports diplomacy. according to 
kedar pavgi and nakul kadaba (2012), the primary aim of qatars endeavors in global 
sport has been to position the country as a leading power broker for business, diplomacy, 
and  foreign  affairs  between western  and  eastern  states.  put  differently,  hosting  major 
international sporting events permits qatar to reconcile its small stature  in a region of 
more considerable powers  with its grand ambitions, demonstrating to a global audience 
its  aptitude  for  accommodating  capitalist  interests  and  islamic  values.  in  turn,  qatars 
investments in global sport, from its sponsorship of top european clubs to its hosting of 
the 2006 asian games, have buttressed its diplomatic brand, allowing it to forge financial 
and political alliances, such as those with france, and to play a mediator role during the 
arab spring (amara 2013). hence, to host a world cup, with all the attention that brings, 
that is widely perceived as corrupt and dismissive of labor migrants welfare would be to 
undermine qatars diplomatic activism and, with it, its ability to cultivate friends when in 
need.   

b. responsibility to respect

of the foundational principles listed in the un guiding principles on business and human 
rights, five are particularly relevant to the corporate responsibility to respect human rights. 
the first two of these five define what responsibility means and identify the human rights 
that businesses must safeguard. principle 11, for example, states that business enterprises 
should respect human rights by recognizing this responsibility as a global standard of 
expected conduct that exists over and above state laws (ruggie 2011). principle 12 
defines human rights as those internationally recognized rights included in the universal 
declaration of human rights (udhr); the international covenant on civil and political 
rights  (iccpr);  the  international  covenant  on  economic,  social,  and  cultural  rights 
(icescr);  and  the  international  labor  organizations  eight  core  conventions  (ruggie 
2011). these two principles are particularly important in the qatari context, as qatar has 
not ratified the iccpr, the icescr, or three of the ilos eight core conventions. even so, 

1  qatar actively supported mohamed morsi and the muslim brotherhood in egypt, islamist militias in 
libya, and a number of opposition factions in syria  moves that sowed greater instability in those countries 
and eventually resulted in diminished qatari clout with their ruling regimes (shapiro 2013).

241

leveraging the world cupcontractors are responsible for these rights because they exist independent of legal liability 
and enforcement (ruggie 2011). hence, they should avoid infringing on these rights as 
well as address the adverse impacts of any rights they do violate.
the next three foundational principles outline the more particular responsibilities attached 
to a respect for human rights. principle 13 defines respect as encompassing both a businesss 
direct activities as well as its relationships with other entities in its value chain. in other 
words,  whether  a  business  directly  causes  adverse  rights  impacts  or  whether  a  trading 
partner causes adverse impacts, the primary business is still responsible for preventing or 
mitigating these harms (ruggie 2011). building on the concept of value chains, principle 
14 specifies that both the primary business and the partnering entity should respect human 
rights. the way each should do so, however, differs depending on their proximity to the 
abuse (ruggie 2011). as such, respect is at times a capacity issue that varies from business 
to business and from relationship to relationship. finally, principle 15 asks that businesses 
adopt policies and processes to show that they are indeed respecting human rights (ruggie 
2011). these include a policy commitment, due diligence systems to identify and account 
for rights abuses, and remediation processes to aid affected individuals or communities.  
although  these  five  principles  call  on  business  enterprises,  such  as  foreign  companies 
and recruitment agencies operating in qatar and coos, to respect human rights, they are 
non-binding. what makes them consequential, however, is their location in a larger risk 
management system. in this context, rights abuses expose complicit companies to a variety 
of risks  reputational, legal, and strategic  that can erode their business value and hurt 
their bottom line if neglected (bhri 2010). for corporate actors, therefore, these risks 
are pressure points that, under the spotlight of world cup 2022, may motivate behavioral 
change.

1.  reputational risk 

business brands, according to the world intellectual property organization (2013), serve as 
a guide for consumers and a means for companies to build a reputation and an image in the 
marketplace. increasingly, due to the widespread availability of information and the pace 
of technological change, brands have become companies most valuable intangible assets 
(abraham et al. 2012). perceptions of human rights abuses, therefore, weigh heavily on a 
companys reputation and, as a result, its brand. rights violations threaten company share 
price, are often difficult to refute, and, even when proven to be false, still leave a mark on a 
businesss brand that takes time to undo. human rights due diligence thus offers companies 
an opportunity to head off these reputational challenges with the intention of preserving 
customer loyalty as well as lucrative governmental and commercial opportunities that are 
based on contracts with strict human rights criteria (amis, brew, and ersmarker 2005).
in  qatar,  ongoing  worker  welfare  abuses,  particularly  those  linked  to  forced  labor  and 
human  trafficking,  bear  serious  consequences  for  contracting  companies  brand  value. 
nicholas mcgeehan states that construction firms in qatar cannot afford not to be there 
but its also an unregulated market that poses reputational risks (hurst 2013). for example, 
ch2m  hill,  an american  firm  contracted  by  the  qatar  2022  supreme  committee  for 
delivery and legacy (q22) to oversee its construction projects was singled out by human 

242

journal on migration and human securityrights watch in 2012 (hrw 2012) and by the international trade union confederation 
(ituc) in 2015 (ituc 2015), as well as in numerous newspaper articles and in a petition 
entitled free qatars modern slaves, which to date has garnered over 828,000 signatures 
(avaaz 2016). ch2m hill has come under scrutiny because of its oversight position, 
and because one of its divisions, the uk engineering firm halcrow, conducted work in 
lusail city, where workers reported instances of withheld pay, confiscated passports, and 
forced labor (pattisson 2013). as michael stephens of the royal united services institute 
has  observed,  even  if  these  reported  abuses  were  the  result  of  an  individual  foreman, 
ch2m hill cannot abdicate responsibility because [it plays] a large role in setting the 
gold standard for labour rights (hurst and withers 2013). these abuses, in line with un 
guiding principle 13, have led activists to call on ch2m hill to take a more proactive role 
in  ending  worker  exploitation  across  its  value  chain.  other  contracting  companies  will 
similarly be scrutinized  and their brands similarly tested  over the next six years.

2.  legal risk 

certain countries present unusually substantial and uncertain legal risks for multinational 
companies (institute of business ethics 2012). in such environments, which include those 
in which executive authority is vested primarily in a single individual or family, the extent to 
which host country laws are enforced is often unclear, and, as a result, companies are more 
prone to treat their legal obligations like optional guidelines (amnesty international 2013). 
doing so, however, runs the risk of violating home country laws  those laws enacted by 
the countries in which these multinational companies are incorporated or headquartered  
including those laws that prohibit human rights violations. one consequence is company 
exposure to litigation. in addition to the potential for reputational risk, litigation may mean 
increased exposure to the costs of legal services, as well as to the costs of out-of-court 
settlements and adverse court judgments. extraterritorial suits for human rights violations 
have already taken place in the united states, the united kingdom, canada, belgium, and 
australia (amis, brew, and ersmarker 2005). another consequence of legal risk is exposure 
to criminal penalties. in the area of labor migrant recruitment, companies and individuals 
found to be complicit in forced labor or human trafficking are subject to criminal sanctions, 
including, in the case of individuals, imprisonment (verite and manpower group 2012). 
the goal of due diligence, in these cases, is to assess which human rights violations a 
company is most susceptible to, in light of home country laws, and to prevent or mitigate 
them accordingly. 
legal risk is a growing concern for companies operating in qatar, where the labor law, 
when enforced, imposes civil ($824 to $82,000 in fines) and criminal (six months to 15 
years in prison) penalties on individuals complicit in forced labor and human trafficking 
(amnesty  international  2013).  this  is  especially  true  for  the  uk  construction  firms 
operating in qatar, including, among others, g&t, aecom, buro happold, grimshaw, and 
paul dollin. according to a 2013 report in building, a uk periodical on the construction 
industry, british attorneys were examining the legal liabilities of these firms if found in 
breach of qatari labor laws. echoing the message of un guiding principle 13, daniel 
leader of the uk law firm leigh day points out that construction firms need to be sure 
of  the  way  they  are  operating  with  regard  to  their  own  workforce  but  also  be  alive  to 
the behaviour of subcontractors (hurst 2013). as such, his firm is offering its services, 

243

leveraging the world cupon  a  conditional  fee  basis,  to  labor  migrants  and  families  based  in  qatar  whose  rights 
have  been  violated  by  uk  construction  firms.  these  legal  risks  will  only  grow  as  the 
pace of infrastructure development quickens with the development of eight stadiums now 
underway.

3.  strategic risk

complicity in human rights abuses may deny businesses a range of opportunities that can 
strategically position them ahead of their competitors. one opportunity is the competitive 
advantage  businesses  gain  by  building  a  base  of  knowledge  and  experience  in  human 
rights due diligence. such a base permits businesses to enter new markets, like those in 
the gcc, where rights abuses exist but where the expertise to address them is still lacking 
(amis, brew, and ersmarker 2005). a second opportunity arises when businesses are able 
to leverage their human rights practices to attract top talent in their industry. a 2005 paper 
by the international business leaders forum found that companies with stronger rights 
records observed a 45 percent increase in unsolicited job applications, while companies 
with poorer rights records exhibited a decline in applications (amis, brew, and ersmarker 
2005). this advantage is all the more important in the gcc context, where the presence of 
foreign firms continues to increase, along with their need for top talent. a final opportunity 
comes in the form of productivity gains. businesses with strong human rights cultures 
are associated with more productive workers who aid profitability, as well as with fewer 
workplace accidents, strikes, bottlenecks, and delays that cut into their bottom lines (amis, 
brew, and ersmarker 2005; bhri 2010). ignoring these opportunities by neglecting human 
rights, therefore, risks leaving value on the table.        
that companies in qatar should capitalize on these opportunities is a point not lost on 
observers of qatars world cup preparations. a migrant worker welfare specialist based 
in  qatar  (personal  communication  2014)  cited  shell,  which  had  built  a  53,000-person 
accommodation for workers just outside doha and instituted a worker grievance mechanism 
similar to a union, as an example of a company that had invested in labor rights and, in 
turn, was witnessing productivity gains. similarly, james ryan of fsi worldwide (fsi), a 
uk-based ethical recruitment agency, noted that, in his firms experience, productivity was 
positively linked with satisfying working and living conditions (personal communication 
2014).  such  a  model  should  be  attractive  to  states  and  companies  with  limited  human 
rights expertise. from fsis modest beginnings placing nepali ex-gurkhas in the security 
industry in iraq and afghanistan, to its expansion into other sectors like construction and 
other markets like the uae, fsis growth demonstrates the opportunities available to firms 
that  embrace  the  corporate  responsibility  to  respect  human  rights.  fsis  model  is  now 
considered a best practice by the ilo, and the agency is one of many recruitment agencies 
that may be included in a qatar foundation initiative to create and disseminate a list of 
preferred recruitment agencies to contractors (ilo 2013a).

iv. the qatari record
worker welfare abuses implicate far more than qatars human rights record  at stake, 
too, is its development trajectory. whether for this reason or others, the qatari government

leveraging the world cuphas undertaken a series of reforms over the past few years aimed at improving living and 
working conditions for its migrant population. these reforms have followed two parallel 
tracks. one track is that taken by the countrys frontline ministries for labor migration 
  namely,  the  mlsa  and  the  ministry  of  interior  (table  5). the  first  set  of  reforms, 
a response to growing criticism from official bodies like the european parliament, was 
published in a february 2014 statement in the guardian (mlsa 2014); just months later, 
a second set, coinciding with the release of a government-commissioned study by the law 
firm dla piper, was announced by qatari officials during a press conference (dla piper 
2014; ministry of interior 2014; kovessy 2014b). animating both sets of reforms, as qatari 
officials (personal communication 2014) have intimated, is the states goal of replacing 
the  kafala  system  with  a  process  premised  on  employment  contracts  and  overseen  by 
the ministry of interior (black, gibson, and booth 2014). complementing these ad hoc 
measures, more broadly, were multilateral ones, such as qatars adoption of the 2014 gcc 
human rights declaration, that aim to reconcile the udhr with the regions cultural and 
religious particularities.
a second track is that pursued by the world cups largest client organizations, notably 
the qatar foundation, a private nonprofit responsible for administering education city, 
and the q22, the organizing committee charged with overseeing world cup preparations. 
both clients, currently responsible for the development of eight world cup sites, have 
created  worker  welfare  standards  to  clarify  the  obligations  assumed  by  contracting 
parties (qatar foundation 2013; q22 2014). these standards include measures spanning 
recruitment, employment, accommodations, and transportation and have been embedded 
in all subsequent contracts tendered by these clients (jureidini 2014). where the track one 
reforms cut to the very viability of the migration system, the track two reforms largely 
concern management of that system.
although  these  measures  appear  promising  on  their  face,  it  is  not  clear  whether  they 
will translate into tangible changes in workers lives, especially in a timeframe that will 
accommodate the growing pace of construction efforts in qatar. it is also not clear if these 
reforms are genuine or, rather, merely lip service aimed at pacifying the chorus of critics 
calling on fifa to strip qatar of its hosting rights. indeed, when amnesty international 
researchers confronted [qatari officials] with . . . evidence of human rights abuses  
evidence that had been collected from february 2015 to february 2016  the governments 
response was apathetic at best (amnesty international 2016a, 4, 73).
drawing  on  interviews  with  a  number  of  experts  familiar  with  qatars  capacity  and 
motivation to undertake reforms, this author is pessimistic about the prospect for effective 
reform of qatars migrant labor law. in terms of huge reforms on the horizon, as one q22 
official put it (personal communication 2014), the qatari government has long promised such 
changes without fully delivering. a project manager at one recruitment agency (personal 
communication 2014) noted that he had long heard rumors of major reforms to the kafala 
system, but observed official government pronouncements to be routinely delayed and, 
once made, often lacking in substance. his observation is confirmed by the new evidence 
from amnesty international (2016) that uncovered widespread and continuing abuses  
chief among them, squalid accommodations and confiscation of passports without penalty 
 tied to the khalifa international stadium site. 

246

journal on migration and human securityunderscoring the above is the governments long-stalled effort to pass and implement its 
february 2014 reforms. the reforms, initially set to be implemented in march, and then 
may, drew little support from qatars business community and shura council (legislative 
body) and were delayed indefinitely (walker 2015). only in december 2015, ultimately, 
were the reforms signed into law as law no. 21 of 2015 regulating the entry, exit, and 
residence of expatriates. yet, those reforms fell far short of the mlsa and ministry of 
interiors initial promises. for example, when law no. 21 finally takes effect in december 
2016, most migrant workers will still be required to obtain their sponsors approval to 
change jobs or to leave the country (amnesty international 2016a, 67).2 law no. 21 would 
even prevent workers who might be victims of abusive practices from freeing themselves 
from these situations (ilo 2016). it is true that law no. 21 contains language prohibiting 
passport confiscation. however, so does the current law, the 2004 labor law, and that 
law  has  essentially  been  enforced  only  in  the  breach  (ilo  2016).  indeed,  the  ilo  has 
found that in small enterprises . . . employers [have] systematically confiscated [worker] 
passports (ilo 2016), while the findings of amnesty international suggest that the practice 
is common at larger companies as well (amnesty international 2016a, 39). given that law 
no. 21 expressly creates an apparently wide loophole allow[ing] employers to retain the 
passport or travel document of any employee, with their consent (amnesty international 
2016a, 74), the problem of passport retention is unlikely to improve much under that law, 
even assuming stricter enforcement.
a  similar  level  of  skepticism  is  warranted  regarding  the  impact  of  the  worker  welfare 
standards. first, although the standards have been adopted by a number of major clients, 
including msheireb properties, qatar rail, q22, and the qatar foundation, there remain 
other  major  construction  clients,  like  doha  port  and  the  civil aviation authority,  that 
have not adopted them. second, the standards devised by the qatar foundation and q22, 
while  largely  similar  in  makeup,  differ  in  some  key  respects    such  as  the  grievance 
mechanisms to which workers can turn  leaving company auditors as well as employees 
with an inconsistent baseline against which to scrutinize labor practices across contracts 
and construction sites. third, these standards only apply to contracts going forward, which 
means that contractor practices giving rise to hundreds of migrant deaths since 2012 will 
be allowed to continue until the work previously contracted for is completed. in fact, q22, 
which expects to have some 50,000 construction workers on its projects over the next six 
years, only had 38 construction workers, through 2014, protected by its welfare standards 
(personal  communication  2014). and  fourth,  auditing  of  construction  sites  and  worker 
accommodations will depend on the mlsas uncertain ability to handle the hundreds of 
thousands of labor migrants projected to arrive in the country over the next several years.
with respect to the fourth point, it is relevant to note that, in the case of q22s construction 
sites, the present administration of the standards is failing (amnesty international 2016a, 
66). although the size of the labor inspection force has increased in recent years, a relatively 
small number of violations [have been] detected in comparison to the large number of 
migrant workers in the country (ilo 2016). the problem of inadequate enforcement is 
particularly  acute  for  workers  at  smaller  companies  (ilo  2016; amnesty  international 

2  law no. 21 does not apply to domestic workers (ilo 2016), and even as to migrant construction workers, 
it significantly relaxes sponsorship requirements only for those workers who have reach[ed] the end of a 
fixed term contract or who have completed five years of work (amnesty international 2016a, 67).

247

leveraging the world cup2016a, 65). for those workers  and for workers at larger companies as well  an over-
reliance on self-reporting severely limits the utility of the worker welfare standards. as 
amnesty international has noted in this very context, self-reporting is a poor enforcement 
tool, as companies that abuse human rights are often willing to make false claims in self-
reporting processes (amnesty international 2016a, 65-66). this self-reporting problem is 
not cured by the existence of three separate bodies charged with validating the self-reports, 
for the first body itself relies on unverified information provided by companies; the second 
had, as of march 2016, never met; and the third, the mlsa, suffers from documented 
weaknesses in the inspection and enforcement process (amnesty international 2016a, 
65-66).3
in light of these facts, the current slate of reforms frequently prescribed by civil society 
groups  and  seemingly  endorsed  by  qatari  bodies  is  unlikely  to  substantially  improve 
worker conditions. on the one hand, the framing of the policy problem  often in terms of 
the intrinsic value of human rights commitments  is largely disconnected from qatars 
development strategy and priorities. on the other hand, the method of execution  placing 
the onus for change on the qatari government  misses other dimensions of the problem, 
motivating  qatari  institutions  to  stall,  if  not  avoid  change  altogether. a  new  approach, 
therefore, is in order.  

v. conclusion and recommendations
as the preceding analysis demonstrates, worker welfare reform is not an enterprise that 
the qatari government can take up alone, even if it were so inclined. certainly, the qatari 
government has primary responsibility for remedying ongoing abuses and, therefore, should 
take the lead in creating an environment that supports workers human rights. this may 
include, among other things, increasing the capacity of labor inspection forces so that the 
current over-reliance on self-reporting by employer is eliminated, closing the loophole that 
allows employers to retain a migrants passport upon that migrants consent, and developing 
worker  welfare  standards  that  have  the  force  of  law  and  that  apply  to  all  construction 
workers.  still, the scale of the problem and the urgency of the moment require that other 
organizations offer their services in a manner that can alleviate the suffering experienced 
by labor migrants across the migration life cycle. timely and feasible solutions, in other 
words, stem from collaborative efforts that draw upon the energy and expertise of multiple 
stakeholders capable of advancing labor protection in ways that the qatari state cannot or 
will not do. 
this article recommends the adoption and implementation of four policy proposals by other 
stakeholders, each targeting a particular phase of the migration life cycle. together, these 
four proposals provide a novel approach to preventing worker welfare abuse. the value 
of these policy options lies in their ability to satisfy three overarching considerations: (1) 
does the option align with the mission and values of key stakeholders; (2) can the option 
3  fifa recently announced an intention to create an oversight body of its own. while the announcement 
was characterized by amnesty international as a small [sign] of progress (amnesty international 2016b), 
human rights watch greeted the announcement more skeptically, with its director of global initiatives 
stating that, [b]y announcing a new body to protect workers, fifa gets to look like theyre taking the issue 
seriously  without having to put any pressure on the qataris to actually take it seriously (worden 2016).

248

journal on migration and human securitybe implemented in light of these stakeholders core capabilities; and (3) does the option 
have enough support from a critical mass of stakeholders to be implemented and sustained? 
what follows is a description of each option and the context in which each is warranted.
first,  qatari  construction  clients,  like  the  qatar  foundation,  should  create  a  preferred 
suppliers  list    consisting  of  recruitment  agencies  engaged  in  ethical  recruitment 
practices  that can be referenced by qatar-based contractors seeking manpower. such 
a measure is consequential in an environment where contractors and subcontractors face 
increasing pressure to address worker welfare abuses committed at any point along their 
value chains. this pressure includes admonitions to discontinue relationships with corrupt 
recruitment  agencies  or  unregulated  labor  brokers. yet,  contractors  and  subcontractors, 
lacking knowledge of industry leaders that employ responsible practices, may be unable to 
make this change without further guidance. 
as such, qatari clients should conduct due diligence on recruitment agencies operating 
in qatar and coos that employ ethical recruitment practices. additionally, they should 
limit eligibility for inclusion in the list to those firms that have a record of placing aspiring 
migrants (1) in concrete and specific jobs, (2) at responsible companies, (3) with suitable 
working  and  living  conditions,  and  (4)  via  clear  and  dependable  contracts  (verite  and 
manpower group 2012).
the  second  recommendation  is  that  coo-based  governmental  and  nongovernmental 
institutions  should  make  available  low-interest,  preferential  loans  to  help  deploying 
migrants finance the costs of the deployment phase. in the absence of qatari companies 
covering migrants visa costs, labor brokers will remain a key source of financing. poor 
record keeping and high-interest rates, however, make these loans particularly burdensome 
for deploying migrants, who often assume high levels of debt and, as a result, are forced to 
commit to jobs in substandard conditions simply to pay down these debts. this debt burden 
is the primary cause of conditions of forced labor. 
coo governments and commercial banks, in turn, should develop loan schemes specific to 
labor migrants, such as pre-departure, housing, or small business loans, recognizing 
that the economic benefits of debt reduction outweigh the losses incurred by extending 
low-interest loans (asfar 2009). one option that may be worth considering is to devise 
loans whose repayment schemes are based on the remitted portions of salaries and whose 
penalties, in case of default, are reasonable.
third,  international  organizations    most  appropriately,  the  international  organization 
for migration (iom)  should establish a migrant resource center (mrc) in doha to 
provide information, counseling, and legal services to labor migrants. although state and 
nongovernmental organizations are beginning to invest in programs that provide aspiring 
migrants with information and services in their home countries, those programs, in general, 
are inadequately used and poorly constructed. compounding the problem is the fact that 
few such programs exist for migrants once they arrive in qatar. iom and other actors have 
experience establishing mrcs as one-stop-shops for delivering information and services 
to migrants, albeit primarily in their home countries (iom 2012). increasingly, however, 
mrcs are being set up in cods, including bahrain and the uae. 

249

leveraging the world cupan mrc in doha would be responsible for creating and distributing informational resources 
on in-country laws, health and safety risks, money transfer mechanisms, and other sources 
of support. it could also offer job search and training programs as well as general subject 
workshops in areas such as project development and financial management (tacon and 
warn  2009).  more  innovatively,  it  could  serve  as  a  congregation  site  for  members  of 
diaspora communities, enabling migrants to build social networks and develop community 
initiatives and activities. and, if resources permitted, it could provide legal and counseling 
services to migrants to aid them in navigating qatars legal system and to cope with the 
psychological aspects of migration (e.g., separation from family).
finally, governmental institutions of coos should conduct reintegration workshops for 
returning labor migrants. upon return to their coos, labor migrants face a number of social 
and economic barriers when reintegrating into their home communities. some governmental 
programs exist that facilitate this reintegration, such as the filipino governments provision 
of small business loans and skills training to returning migrants (go 2012). select iom 
country offices, meanwhile, provide returning migrants with counseling, medical checks, 
transportation, and grants, among other services, as part of the assisted voluntary return 
and reintegration (avrr) program, a product of the 2002 bali process on human trafficking 
and transnational crime (iom 2012). both forms of assistance, however, are small in scale 
and encompass few coos. more importantly, these actors often place greater emphasis on 
pre-departure services than reintegration services, overlooking critical migrant needs at the 
end of the migration life cycle. 
governmental  agencies  of  coos,  therefore,  should  provide  reintegration  training  that 
includes, among other services, skill development, financial literacy, repatriation assistance, 
and  individual  and  family  counseling.  they  could  partner  with  existing  in-country
