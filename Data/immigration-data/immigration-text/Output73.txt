 executive summary
housing is an important determinant of quality of life and migrants are 
more  likely  to  encounter  poor  quality  housing  than  natives.  this  paper 
draws on the capabilities approach to welfare economics to examine how 
issues  of  housing  and  neighborhood  conditions  influence  quality  of  life 
and opportunities for migrants in western europe. the analysis utilizes 
data from the second european quality of life survey (eqls) to explore 
variation  in  life  and  housing  satisfaction  between  migrants  and  non-
migrants (natives) in western europe and whether being a migrant and 
living in an ethnically diverse neighborhood contribute to lower satisfaction. 
the results show that migrants are more likely to experience lower levels 
of life and housing satisfaction and that living in a diverse neighborhood 
is negatively associated with life and housing satisfaction. while diverse, 
inner-city  neighborhoods  can  increase  opportunities  for  labor  market 
access,  social  services  and  integration,  the  tendency  towards  clustered 
settlement by migrants can also compound housing inequality. conversely, 
migrant homeowners are on average substantially more satisfied with the 
quality of public services and of their neighborhood and have lower material 
deprivation than both migrant and non-migrant renters. the findings draw 
attention to the need to address housing and neighborhood conditions in 
order to improve opportunities for integration and well-being.

inadequate housing can have negative effects upon the health and well-being for all groups 
within  society.  these  effects  are  arguably  greater  for  migrant  communities  given  that 
housing represents an important mechanism for the cultural, social and economic integration 
of migrants into their host societies (chambon et al. 1997). since the second world war, 
immigrants  in  the  european  union  have  encountered  disproportionate  levels  of  social 
exclusion. research shows that housing conditions for migrants in many western countries 
tend to be worse than average across the housing stock with problems of overcrowding, 
poor standards and homelessness (chambon et al. 1997; carter 2005; harrison 2005).  the 
international literature has established that the housing opportunities and choices available 
to migrants underperform those available to natives. research across a number of western 
countries highlights the propensity for migrants to settle in specific areas of a host society, 
often  clustering  in  resource  deprived  urban  environments,  which  can  compound  their 
housing inequality (gordon and travers 2006; maloutas 2007; wessel 2001; massey and 
fischer 2000). 
the  capabilities  approach  to  welfare  economics,  introduced  by  amartya  sen  (1985; 
1992), broadens the scope of poverty assessment to include measures such as education, 
employment and health and has influenced an interdisciplinary literature on the human 
development paradigm. the capabilities approach results in a more holistic evaluation 
of  outcomes  than  traditional  welfare  economics  which  has  tended  to  focus  squarely 
on  measures  of  material  well-being.  capability  is  the  freedom  to  achieve  valuable 
functionings, or what an individual is able to do with a given set of resources. a persons 
total opportunities depend on the set of all functionings from which they can choose given 
the resources at their command. the importance of freedom for well-being is a central tenet 
of the capabilities approach and informs the distinction between what people are free to do 
(their capabilities or beings) and what they do (their functionings or doings). with an 
emphasis on freedom, opportunity and social choice, the capabilities approach recognizes 
the intrinsic value of choice and affords to choice a central positionmaking its place 
in well-being and social justice evaluations more explicit (robeyns 2003; lelkes 2005). 
housing plays an important role in shaping both experienced quality of life as well as the 
opportunities a person has. housing is an important determinant of the beings and doings 
that are central to sens capabilities approach. this paper applies the capabilities approach 
to issues of housing and neighborhood conditions. it addresses functional capabilities using 
data on well-being from the second european quality of life survey (eqls) to examine 
the migrant experience. this analysis goes beyond examination of material deprivation to 
consider the impact of housing on life satisfaction, access to services, quality of services, 
quality  of  neighborhood  and  opportunities  afforded  to  residents.  we  explore  whether 
there are measurable variations in life satisfaction, in general, and housing satisfaction, in 
particular, between non-migrants (natives) and migrants in western europe and whether 
being a migrant, and living in an ethnically diverse neighborhood, contributes to lower 
satisfaction.
migration and housing patterns in western europe
migration has been a key feature of demographic dynamics of europe over recent decades. 
ethnic pluralization of european countries is the product of both past and contemporary

statham 2000). by the mid-point of the last decade more than 15 million persons residing 
across the eu were third-country nationals. 
the experience of the recipient european countries has not been homogenous (salt 1997). 
triandafyllidou (2011) classifies eu member-states into two camps:  old hosts and recent 
hosts. the former have a long history of inward migration, a sizable migrant population 
and advanced integration policies. the latter are geographically peripheral and do not have 
a  long  experience  of  absorbing  migrant  communities. an  important  development  over 
the past decade has been the influence of labor market-related factors (oecd 2006). the 
accession of 12 new member-states to the eu since 2004 has drawn attention to the different 
policy responses of western european countries. only the united kingdom, ireland and 
sweden opened their labor markets to nationals of the eight accession states beginning in 
2004. 
assimilation  has  been  defined  as  the  social,  economic  and  political  integration  of  an 
ethnic minority group into mainstream society (keefe and padilla 1987). it can be argued 
that  one  aspect  of  assimilation  occurs  through  progressive  advancement  in  a  housing 
career (abramsson et al. 2002). migrants tend to start their housing career at the lowest 
end of the market and, as they become more assimilated into the host society, move on to 
better quality housing conditions over time. new arrivals tend to lack both the resources 
and knowledge concerning the workings of the housing market in the host country. it is 
expected that these are accumulated over time, leading to improvement in the quality of the 
accommodation accessed.1 research also suggests that as migrants socio-economic status 
improves, they tend to move to the suburbs where the balance between the foreign- and 
native-born populations is more even (dunn 1998; blom 1999). 
spatial  segregation  upon  the  basis  of  ethnic  or  racial  difference  has  been  a  feature  of 
many western societies (fahey and fanning 2009). spatial, and particularly residential, 
segregation has been identified as a principal contributory factor to urban poverty (massey 
and fischer 2000). segregation can deepen over time as new patterns of settlement become 
superimposed  upon  pre-existing  neighborhood  divisions  (van  kempen  2007).  a  large 
body of research has associated the negative housing experiences of many ethnic minority 
(including  migrant)  households  with  racism  and  xenophobia.  discrimination  in  other 
public spheres, such as labor market access, can undermine access to good quality housing 
for migrants (de beijl 2000).
there is, however, some scope for the role of opportunity structures to mitigate the impact 
of social exclusion, material deprivation and discrimination. the process of migrating to a 
new country is often traumatic and can involve feelings of loss, separation and helplessness. 
migrants therefore seek communal enclaves which can mitigate negative psychological 
impacts,  provide  alternative  social  structures,  facilitate  the  preservation  of  cultural 
traditions and mediate interaction with the new host society (mazumdar et al. 2000). it can 
be argued that the physical concentration of migrants plays a positive role in fostering social 
cohesion (peach 1996). murie and musterd have looked at the role of cities, and inner-
city neighborhoods in particular, in alleviating exclusion by encouraging participation and 

1  it is worth noting, however that some migrants, whether recent or long-standing, have substantial resources 
and good quality housing (for instance, the global business class).

market access, social services, and mutual support (ibid.).  

data and methods 
the analysis was undertaken using data from the second european quality of life survey 
(eqls). this survey was conducted by the european foundation for the improvement of 
living and working conditions between 2007 and 2008 and contains information gathered 
from 35,000 interviews across 31 countries. the dataset provides a unique opportunity 
to explore quality of life throughout europehighlighting for policy makers and other 
interested groups the social and economic challenges facing the eu in the wake of the two 
recent rounds of enlargement (eurofound 2009). 
respondents were asked to assess their living conditions including the quality of public 
services, neighborhood satisfaction, access to public services, and material deprivation at 
the household level. respondents were asked whether they were born in their country of 
residence, in another eu member-state or outside of the european union. the eqls also 
includes a subjective assessment of the level of ethnic diversity of the local neighborhood. 
this  combination  of  questions  allows  the  present  analysis  to  provide  a  comparative 
empirical characterization of the experienced utility of migrant communities. 
it is important to note that there are a number of limitations to the data. first, the eqls 
does not contain any distinct variable which would allow the authors to test the potential 
impact of discrimination on visible, or non-white, ethnic minorities. the data also does 
not  capture  the  incidence  of  moving  during  the  inter-survey  period  nor  does  it  capture 
how long a migrant has been living in his or her country of residence. survey respondents 
were not asked to state their specific country of origin. respondents were simply asked to 
state whether they were born in the country where they reside and, if not, to state whether 
they originated from another eu member-state or from a non-eu country in europe, asia, 
africa, north or south america. it was therefore not possible to specifically examine the 
experiences of migrants in western europe from recent accession states such as poland 
or romania. there is also no specification for ethnic minorities, such as roma or irish 
travelers, in the survey dataset.
the analysis narrowly defines a migrant as a person not born in an eu member-state but 
living in western europe at the time of the survey (referred to as an extra-eu migrant). 
the analysis does, however, draw out some differentiation between extra-eu and intra-eu 
migrants.2  the scope of the research is limited to western europe (or eu15) rather than the 
entire european union (or eu27) and examines the experience of survey respondents in the 
former only. this was done for a number of reasons. the international literature suggests 

2  intra-eu migrants are survey respondents who did not reside in their country of origin in 2007 but were 
born in another eu member-state, thus including migrants from eastern and central european accession 
states. intra-eu migration has accounted for a significant proportion of total migration into western europe in 
recent years. there is emerging evidence that migrants from eastern european eu accession states are living 
in inferior housing conditions in western european states. further work is needed to assess how the housing 
situations of intra-eu migrant groups may differ with the different rights and opportunities associated with 
their legal status.  

166

market opportunities, economic strength, historical and cultural ties to former colonies and 
geographic proximity. recent statistical data suggest that most immigrants living in europe 
(whether from an eu member-state or from outside of the eu) are residing in the eu15.
in order to operationalize the capabilities approach and develop a set of measures which 
are conducive to this end, the analysis places emphasis on responses concerned with the 
distribution of resources and subjective measures of well-being, including both life and 
housing satisfaction.3 the analysis investigates the distribution of individual material and 
non-material  resources  between  migrants  and  non-migrants  using  four  quality  of  life 
(qol) indices derived from the survey data. the indices are used to compare and contrast 
mean outcomes and are applied in a series of estimation models.

functionings, capability sets and indicators of resources

individuals endeavour to satisfy their needs and preferences within the constraints of the 
resources at their disposal. access to, and control over, resources is an important prerequisite 
for the achievement of a high quality of life. resources can include material assets alongside 
non-material resources such as access to services. peoples ability to convert resources into 
valued functionings can and does differ. according to the capabilities approach, it is not the 
mere existence of a resource that matters but what it enables an individual to do and be. 
indicators  of  resources  can  be  used  as  effective  proxies  for  functionings  and  in  the 
estimation of capability sets (alkire 2008). the qol indices employed by this analysis are 
indicators of resources that combine standard measures of material deprivation with other 
measures derived from subjective assessments. survey respondents were asked to assign a 
rating to a series of aspects of day-to-day life from the ability to pay utility bills to public 
safety and the quality of childcare provision.4 these ratings were used to construct four 
qol indices concerning material and non-material resources: access to services;5 quality of 
public services;6 neighborhood satisfaction;7 and material deprivation.8
3  it is important to note that subjective quality of life survey data may be influenced by diverse socially and 
culturally informed expectations against which satisfaction is measured and reported by migrant households. 
4  the responses under each category are used to compile an index allocating a score to each respondent. 
these are summed to determine a master score under each index and no weightings have been attached to 
particular responses or categories. the cumulative responses have been re-based so that a score of 10 is the 
maximum. 
5  poor access to services index score: respondents were asked a series of questions with regard to whether 
specified services are available within walking distance and to provide a binary response (e.g., yes or no) with 
respect to six distinct services.  this index reflects the cumulative responses across each of these specified 
services where a higher score indicates a poorer level of access to all of the services specified in the survey. 
6  neighborhood dissatisfaction index score: respondents were asked a series of questions with regard to 
whether they were dissatisfied with the immediate neighborhood and whether they had reason to complain 
about specific issues such as crime, noise, access to green areas and air pollution. a higher score indicates a 
higher level of neighborhood dissatisfaction. 
7   quality  of  public  services  index  score:  respondents  were  asked  a  series  of  questions  with  regard  to 
how they would rate the quality of public services available to them including healthcare, public transport, 
childcare and pensions. a higher score indicates a higher level of satisfaction with services. 
8  material deprivation index score: respondents were asked a series of questions with regard to whether 
they had encountered certain specified forms of material deprivation including whether they had been in 
arrears with their rent or utility bills, whether they found it difficult to make ends meet and/or whether they 
have insufficient money for food. a higher score indicates a higher level of material deprivation.

housing and quality of life for migrants in western europemodel estimations

the papers use of subjective measures of well-being in regression models is in line with 
emergent trends in the broader applied welfare economics literature. specifically, subjective 
measures of well-being have been applied within the capabilities approach as a dependent 
variable representing experienced utility (diener and suh 1997; kahneman et al. 1997; 
anand and van hees 2005; anand et al. 2005; layard 2005; alkire 2008; sen 2008). 
the  relationship  between  being  a  migrant  in western  europe,  housing  satisfaction  and 
subjective  well-being  is  estimated  using  a  model  of  experienced  utility  where  the 
dependent  variable  (e.g.,  subjective  housing  satisfaction)  is  a  function  of  a  series  of 
dependent  variables,  including  migrant  status. the  results  of  the  analysis  are  generally 
presented at the pan-european level in order to provide a comparative perspective that has 
sometimes been absent from single-country or regional case studies. the pan-european 
data is supplemented with results at the national level in order to tease out variations across 
western europe.

analysis and descriptive results

distribution of material and non-material resources 

the first step in the analysis is to present a comparison of mean outcomes for the population 
sub-groups using the four qol sub-indices outlined above. we consider the differences in 
the mean (and standard deviations) for non-migrants and migrants at the pan-european 
and  national  levels9  (see  table  1).  the  pan-european  level  results  include  both  extra-
eu  migrants  and  intra-eu  migrants. the  results  show  that  on  average  migrants  report 
lower scores than non-migrants, indicating a marked variance in resource distribution.10 
the  mean  material deprivation score  for  non-migrants  was  1.22  on  a  scale  of  1  to  10, 
with 10 representing the maximum level of deprivation. the mean score for migrants in 
western  europe  was  1.92,  suggesting  that  material  deprivation  was  50  percent  higher 
among migrants. non-migrants outperformed migrants in almost every country with very 
few exceptions. this distributional disparity is not confined solely to material measures 
of well-being. in terms of quality of services, the mean score for non-migrants was 5.63, 
compared to 5.42 for migrants (with a higher score indicating a higher level of satisfaction 
with services). a similar outcome is evident under the mean neighborhood dissatisfaction 
score with migrants reporting higher levels of dissatisfaction than non-migrants. 
table  2  takes  this  analysis  a  step  further  by  disaggregating  migrants  and  non-migrants 
by  housing  tenure.  this  disaggregation  reveals  greater  subtlety  depending  on  whether 
respondents are homeowners or renters. the mean material deprivation score for migrant 
homeowners (1.30) is almost 50 percent lower than it is for migrant renters (2.40). on 
average, migrant homeowners are substantially more satisfied with the quality of the public 

9  at the individual country level, the population size (and the number of migrants in the sample) can be very 
limited in some instances and as such, a degree of caution is required in the interpretation of separate country 
effects.
10  the results of a series of person chi-squared tests demonstrate that the distribution of the indicators 
of resources (or functionings) is statistically different between the various groups (non-migrants; extra-eu 
migrants; and intra-eu migrants).

168

between  migrant  homeowners  and  non-migrants  also  yields  a  number  of  interesting 
observations.  migrant  homeowners  perform  markedly  better  than  non-migrant  renters 
under three of the qol sub-indices. migrant homeowners have a lower mean deprivation 
score (1.30) than non-migrant renters (2.00) whilst the former group was also more satisfied 
with  the  quality  of  public  services  and  neighborhood. the  mean  outcomes  for  migrant 
homeowners tended to be quite close to those of non-migrant homeowners although non-
migrant homeowners still outperformed their migrant peers. 
these findings suggest that housing tenure is, in fact, a more substantive determinant of the 
mean outcomes cited above than whether or not a respondent was born in western europe. 
this is not the full picture, however, as migrants typically reside in rented accommodation 
during their first years in the receiving country. a migrant is conceivably more likely to 
become a homeowner over time. in this sense, housing tenure may potentially act as a 
proxy for time spent in the receiving country,11 although finances are not directly linked to 
length of residence.12 

qol sub-indices for population sub-groups

to provide an empirical characterization of the impact of migrant status on the four indices,  
we estimate a model using the indices as the dependent variable(s) with a dummy denoting 
a  migrant  survey  respondent  as  an  explanatory  variable. we  also  expand  the  model  to 
consider the impact of  a  series of  controls  on  the predictive power  of  this  explanatory 
variable. in addition, later iterations of the model introduce a series of interaction terms 
denoting a migrant living in a specified western european country and a control denoting 
neighborhood  diversity. these  controls  are  grouped  into  blocks  and  added  sequentially 
before a final iteration in which the full model is estimated.
the tests commence with a model that considers the relationship between the poor access 
to services index score and migrant status. the results of this multiple regression model are 
presented in table 3. in the first iteration of the model, being a migrant is negatively related 
the poor access to services index score. however, this stand-alone explanatory variable 
describes only a very small portion of the observed variance.13 the results nevertheless 
indicate that being a migrant is not a predictor of dissatisfaction with access to services. it 
may be that some ease-of-access (or at least proximity) arises due to migrants being more 
likely  to  live  in  heavily-populated  and  centrally-located  urban  areas  which  offer  better 
opportunity structures for integration. 
in the case of the neighborhood dissatisfaction index score, the first iteration of the 
model indicates that being a migrant is positively related to higher dissatisfaction (table 
4). the full version of the second model indicates that the variables are jointly significant 
but does not suggest that being a migrant is by itself a predictor of higher neighborhood 
dissatisfaction.14 
11  this variable is not captured in the eqls dataset.
12  this implies that homeownership is a function of wealth which is accumulated by migrants over time in 
the country of settlement. however, some recent migrants do have access to substantial resources.
13  the first iteration of each of the four models indicates that this single variable explains only a very small 
portion of the observed variance.
14  in the case of access to services and neighborhood dissatisfaction, intra-eu migrants were found to be 
not statistically significant with regard to the former and statistically significant but negatively related to the 
latter.

housing and quality of life for migrants in western europein the case of the quality of public services index score, the first iteration of the model 
indicates that being a migrant is negatively related to the perceived quality of public services 
(table 5). in later versions, the explanatory power of the model gradually improves and the 
independent variable remains negatively related to the quality of public services index 
score. the full version of the model indicates that the variables are jointly significant. 
however, being a migrant is not statistically significant. 
lastly,  the  first  iteration  of  the  material  deprivation  index  score  model  indicates 
that being a migrant is positively related to perceived material deprivation (table 6). in 
subsequent tests, the primary independent variable remains a good predictor of material 
deprivation. the full model indicates that the variables are jointly significant and suggests 
that migrants do encounter disproportionate material deprivation, perhaps associated with 
unequal access to resources due to their relatively low level of capital (including financial 
support, language skills and labor market access).15 

covariates  of  subjective  well-being  and  housing  satisfaction: 

comparative analysis across western europe
the final step in the analysis is to consider the differences in life and housing satisfaction 
between non-migrants and migrants from a capabilities perspective using the survey data 
on selected measures of subjective well-being (see tables 7 and 8). the results indicate that 
there is, in fact, a measurable difference in the experienced utility between the two groups. 
in terms of self-reported well-being, the mean life satisfaction for non-migrants was 7.61 
(with a standard deviation of 1.81). the mean life satisfaction for migrants was lower at 
7.55 (1.79), measured on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 representing maximum satisfaction. 
a similar gap can be observed at the individual country level. for example, the mean life 
satisfaction of non-migrants in belgium was 7.79 but this falls to just 7.44 in the case 
of  migrants.  in  terms  of  housing  satisfaction,  the  mean  result  for  non-migrants  across 
western europe was 7.76 (2.01) compared to a substantially lower mean of 7.20 (2.29) for 
migrants.16

indicators  of  resources,  subjective  well-being  and  housing 

satisfaction
the data provide scope to consider whether there is a link between each of the indices 
(or indicators of resources), subjective well-being and housing satisfaction. the literature 
suggests that housing satisfaction acts as an intermediate variable across the themes captured 
in  the  indices  and  subjective  well-being  more  generally  (prezza  and  constantini  1998; 
diaz-serrano 2006). it could be speculated that the the lower mean satisfaction expressed 
by migrants may be, to some extent at least, a function of the housing and neighborhoods 
in which they live. 

15  in the case of perceived public service quality and material deprivation, intra-eu migrants were found to 
be statistically significant but negatively related to the former and not statistically significant with regard to 
the latter.
16  intra-eu migrants outperformed migrants in the eu with regard to both life and housing satisfaction. 
similar results were found in the case of many individual countries. 

182

journal on migration and human securitythe results show that the level of satisfaction with the neighborhood, perceived quality of public 
services and perceived material deprivation are all statistically significant and influence housing 
satisfaction, even after a series of controls are introduced to the estimation. these results are 
highly  intuitive.  higher  levels  of  neighborhood  dissatisfaction  and  material  deprivation  are 
negatively related to housing satisfaction. higher quality public services are positively related 
to housing satisfaction. the results for subjective well-being are very similar (see table 9). 
the level of access to services was not a statistically significant predictor of either housing 
satisfaction or subjective well-being.

model estimation for subjective well-being

the results indicate that being a migrant in western europe is not a statistically significant 
determinant of life satisfaction although this single independent variable alone does not explain 
the observed variance (table 10).  in later iterations, the results indicate that 11 countries were 
positively associated with qol, however being a migrant into  greece, italy and portugal was 
negatively associated with qol, which may suggest some level of decoupling across the eu. 
the variable denoting a migrant respondent remained statistically insignificant in this model and 
in later iterations. finally, in the full version of the model, we again consider the relationship 
between subjective well-being and migrant status with all controls included.17 the results of the 
full version of the model show that the independent variables are jointly significant, but that 
being a migrant is not statistically significant.18 

model estimation for housing satisfaction

the analysis also modeled the relationship between being a migrant and housing satisfaction 
(table 11). the results indicate that being a migrant in western europe is a statistically significant 
determinant of housing satisfaction and is negatively related to housing satisfaction; however 
this independent variable alone cannot explain the observed variance in housing satisfaction. 
the second iteration of the model re-estimates the relationship between housing satisfaction and 
migrant status when the respondents country of residence is controlled for. after introducing 
a range of additional controls, being a migrant remained a predictor of housing dissatisfaction 
in  all  cases.  in  the  full  version  of  the  model  with  all  controls  included,19  the  independent 
variables are jointly significant, suggesting that migrants are less likely to be satisfied with 
their housing.20 these findings reflect the literature which reports that migrants are more likely 
to face higher housing costs, discrimination and lower quality housing. we can surmise that 
housing satisfaction also acts as a mediating variable that picks up elements of the previous 
findings regarding service quality, neighborhood dissatisfaction and material deprivation.

17  this adds almost 14 percent to the r-squared. 
18  where intra-eu migrants are applied as an independent variable, the results also indicate that being a migrant 
is not statistically significant.
19  the full version of the model adds 19 percent to the r-squared, as compared to the first, restricted model. 
20  where intra-eu migrants are applied as an independent variable, the results indicate that being a migrant is not 
statistically significant.

housing and quality of life for migrants in western europethe influence of ethnically diverse neighborhoods

in addition to the finding that being a migrant is a statistically significant predictor of housing 
dissatisfaction, the analysis also shows that living in what the respondent considers to be a 
diverse neighborhood is negatively associated with both life and housing satisfaction. this 
variable is also found to be a significant predictor of dissatisfaction with the neighborhood 
and quality of services and the incidence of material deprivation. the influence of ethnically 
diverse neighborhoods may reflect the role of patterns of settlement, segregation and ethnic 
clustering in shaping the experienced utility of migrant communities. migrants are more 
than three times more likely to be living in an ethnically diverse neighborhood than non-
migrants at the pan-european level (see table 12).

conclusion
the findings suggest that migrants are more likely to experience lower levels of housing 
satisfaction than non-migrant populations across western europe. migrants also tend to 
perform  comparatively  worse  in  terms  of  the  distribution  of  material  and  non-material 
resources. however, the results do not suggest that being a migrant is a significant predictor 
of lower subjective well-being or greater dissatisfaction with the neighborhood in which 
they live. yet, living in what the respondent considers to be a diverse neighborhood is 
found to be negatively related to both life and housing satisfaction. it can be hypothesized 
that this apparent contradiction reflects some positive aspects of clustered settlement in 
diverse, inner-city neighborhoods such as providing a sense of belonging and fostering 
social networks.  
the inclusion of this variable may play an important role in improving the understanding 
of the determinants of satisfaction. the tendency towards clustering in ethnically diverse 
neighborhoods suggests then that the lower mean life and housing satisfaction expressed 
by migrants may be, to some extent at least, a function of living in these neighborhoods.

overlaps directly with disparities in resource distribution and constraints on opportunities 
and choice.
the findings have policy implications for the improvement of quality of life for migrant 
communities.  first,  the  overlap  of  migrants  housing  dissatisfaction  with  the  incidence 
of material deprivation suggests a greater role for governmental intervention (or that of 
not-for-profit bodies) in the provision of adequate information and assistance in securing 
accommodation. second, as housing dissatisfaction among migrants also overlaps with the 
incidence of living in an ethnically diverse neighborhood, targeted measures such urban 
revitalization programs to improve housing standards in these areas can increase migrants 
well-being.
