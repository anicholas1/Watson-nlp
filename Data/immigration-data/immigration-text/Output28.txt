purpose: since 2007 visa overstays 
have outnumbered undocumented 
border crossers by a half million

executive summary
the trump administration has made the construction of an impregnable 
2,000-mile wall across the length of the us-mexico border a centerpiece of its 
executive orders on immigration and its broader immigration enforcement 
strategy. this initiative has been broadly criticized based on:
  escalating  cost  projections:  an  internal  department  of  homeland 
security (dhs) study recently set the cost at $21.6 billion over three 
and a half years;

  its  necessity  given  the  many  other  enforcement  tools    video 
surveillance,  drones,  ground  sensors,  and  radar  technologies    and 
border patrol personnel, that cover the us-mexico border: former dhs 
secretary michael chertoff and other experts have argued that a wall 
does not add enforcement value except in heavy crossing areas near 
towns, highways, or other vanishing points (kerwin 2016);

  its  cost-effectiveness  given  diminished  border  patrol  apprehensions 
(to roughly one-fourth the level of historic highs) and reduced illegal 
entries (to roughly one-tenth the 2005 level according to an internal 
dhs study) (martinez 2016);

  its efficacy as an enforcement tool: between fy 2010 and fy 2015, the 
current 654-mile pedestrian wall was breached 9,287 times (gao 2017, 
22);

  its inability to meet the administrations goal of securing operational 
control of the border, defined as the prevention of all unlawful entries 
to the united states (white house 2017);

  its  deleterious  impact  on  bi-national  border  communities,  the 

environment, and property rights (heyman 2013); and

 2017 by the center for migration studies of new york. all rights reserved.jmhs volume 5 number 1 (2017): 124-136 opportunity costs in the form of foregone investments in addressing the
conditions that drive large-scale migration, as well as in more effective
national security and immigration enforcement strategies.

the center for migration studies (cms) has reported on the dramatic decline 
in the us undocumented population between 2008 and 2014 (warren 2016). 
in addition, a growing percentage of border crossers in recent years have 
originated in the northern triangle states of central america (cbp 2016). 
these migrants are fleeing pervasive violence, persecution, and poverty, 
and a large number do not seek to evade arrest, but present themselves to 
border officials and request political asylum. many are de facto refugees, 
not illegal border crossers.
this report speaks to another reason to question the necessity and value of 
a 2,000-mile wall: it does not reflect the reality of how the large majority 
of  persons  now  become  undocumented.  it  finds  that  two-thirds  of  those 
who arrived in 2014 did not illegally cross a border, but were admitted 
(after screening) on non-immigrant (temporary) visas, and then overstayed 
their period of admission or otherwise violated the terms of their visas. 
moreover, this trend in increasing percentages of visa overstays will likely 
continue into the foreseeable future.
the  report  presents  information  about  the  mode  of  arrival  of  the 
undocumented population that resided in the united states in 2014. to 
simplify the presentation, it divides the 2014 population into two groups: 
overstays and entries without inspection (ewis). the term overstay, as 
used  in  this  paper,  refers  to  undocumented  residents  who  entered  the 
united  states  with  valid  temporary  visas  and  subsequently  established 
residence without authorization. the term ewi refers to undocumented 
residents who entered without proper immigration documents across the 
southern border. 
the estimates are based primarily on detailed estimates of the undocumented 
population in 2014 compiled by cms and estimates of overstays for 2015 
derived by dhs. major findings include the following:
 in  2014,  about  4.5  million  us  residents,  or  42  percent  of  the  total

undocumented population, were overstays.

 overstays  accounted  for  about  two-thirds  (66  percent)  of  those  who

arrived (i.e., joined the undocumented population) in 2014.

 overstays have exceeded ewis every year since 2007, and 600,000 more

overstays than ewis have arrived since 2007.

 mexico is the leading country for both overstays and ewis; about one-

third of undocumented arrivals from mexico in 2014 were overstays.

 california has the largest number of overstays (890,000), followed by

new york (520,000), texas (475,000), and florida (435,000).

125

the 2,000 mile wall in search of a purpose  two states had 47 percent of the 6.4 million ewis in 2014: california 

(1.7 million) and texas (1.3 million).

  the percentage of overstays varies widely by state: more than two-thirds 
of the undocumented who live in hawaii, massachusetts, connecticut, 
and  pennsylvania  are  overstays.  by  contrast,  the  undocumented 
population  in  kansas,  arkansas,  and  new  mexico  consists  of  fewer 
than 25 percent overstays. 

introduction
undocumented  immigration  has  been  a  major  national  concern  in  recent  years,  and 
efforts to resolve the issue are likely to remain near the top of the new administrations 
agenda.  this  report  seeks  to  add  clarity  to  the  discussion  of  alternative  policies  by 
presenting demographic information on the mode of arrival  overstays and ewis  of 
the undocumented population that lived in the us in 2014. the finding that ewis have 
accounted for fewer than 40 percent of all undocumented arrivals since 2010, and just one-
third of arrivals in 2014, raises questions about the necessity and efficacy of extending the 
border wall.
an important component of the estimates, overstays by country of origin, relies on dhs 
information about overstays in 2015 (dhs 2015). the dhs estimates of overstays were 
derived primarily from the arrival departure information system (adis), which tracks the 
arrival and departure of temporary visitors admitted for business or pleasure. the second 
component, detailed estimates of the undocumented population in 2014, was derived by 
cms (warren 2016). the procedures used to derive estimates of overstays and ewis are 
described in detail in the appendix. before proceeding, two important aspects of these 
estimates merit attention. 
  first, nearly all ewis come from just six countries  mexico, el salvador, guatemala, 
honduras, nicaragua, and dominican republic. to derive the total number of overstays 
in the united states, cms compiled estimates of overstays for those six countries and 
then added the number of undocumented arrivals from all other countries.1 ewis were 
estimated as the difference between the total population and the number of overstays.

  second,  the  percentage  of  overstays  in  a  state  is  strongly  influenced  by  how  many 
undocumented residents from mexico live in the state. about 55 percent of undocumented 
immigrants are from mexico, and the large majority of them are ewis.

mode of arrival

before 2007, well over half of all undocumented arrivals were ewis (figure 1).2 in fact, as 
recently as 2005, ewi arrivals exceeded overstays by about 120,000. the number of ewi 
1   to take account of the likelihood that at least some undocumented residents from all other countries were 
ewis, cms assumed that .1 percent of undocumented residents who arrived from all other countries were 
ewis. 
2   in all three figures in this report, the trend lines were smoothed using a three-year moving average.

126

journal on migration and human securityarrivals began a steep decline after 2005, falling from 340,000 in 2005 to 140,000 in 2013. 
since the crossover in these trends in 2007, the total number of overstays has exceeded 
ewis by about 600,000 (figure 1).

mode of entry (rounded to 5,000s)

 

the steep drop in ewis from 2005 to 2010 shown in figure 1 is the result of a sharp decline 
in undocumented immigration from mexico after 2005. this is clearly illustrated by figure 
2, which shows the undocumented population from mexico in 2014, by year of entry.

the 2,000 mile wall in search of a purposethe trends shown in figures 1 and 2 produced the pattern of overstay rates shown in figure 
3. the percentage of overstays increased somewhat from 1995 to 2000, stayed steady until 
2004, and then increased rapidly from 2005 to 2010 (figure 3). this occurred because, 
as we have seen, after 2005 the number of ewis fell rapidly while overstays remained at 
roughly the same level. overstays reached 61 percent of the total in 2010 and continued to 
rise, reaching about two-thirds (66 percent) of the total in 2014.

table 1 shows estimates for the 10 states with the highest percentage of overstays and the 10 
states with the lowest percentage. the states with the highest percentage of overstays range 
from 96 percent in hawaii3 to 59 percent in michigan. in the 10 high-overstay states, nine 
of which are in the eastern part of the country, only 22 percent of the total undocumented 
population is from mexico. 
the 10 states with the lowest percentage overstays range from 31 percent in colorado to 
22 percent in new mexico (table 1). in these 10 states combined, slightly more than three 
quarters (77%) of the total undocumented residents are from mexico. most of the low-
overstay states are in the western part of the country.

3   it might seem unlikely that ewis would be living in hawaii, but these estimates refer to the population living 
in the united states in 2014.  one explanation could be that ewis that entered in prior years subsequently 
moved to hawaii.

estimates of overstays and ewis by state have not previously been available. table 2 below 
shows estimates of the undocumented population, along with the percent that overstayed, 
for every state as of 2014. caution should be exercised in the use and interpretation of 
these  estimates  because  they  are  subject  to  sampling  variability,  non-sampling  errors, 
and  limitations  in  the  assumptions.  however,  as  described  in  the  appendix,  reasonable 
alternative assumptions would change any of the percentages shown in this report by only 
a couple of percentage points.

conclusion and recommendations
the estimates of overstays presented in this paper make it clear that since 2005 a significant 
shift has occurred in the mode of arrival of undocumented immigrants to this country. even 

130

journal on migration and human securitythough fewer than half (42%) of the total population living in the united states in 2014 
were overstays, that percentage will continue to increase as long as overstaying continues to 
be the predominant mode of arrival into the undocumented population, as it has been since 
2005. in 2014 about two-thirds (66%) of all arrivals were overstays. the changing trends 
are largely the result of the drop in undocumented immigration from mexico, especially 
since 2005. the two most important demographic conclusions from these estimates are: 
(1) after 2007, overstaying a temporary visa became the primary means of entering the 
undocumented population, and (2) the sharp drop in arrivals from mexico since 2005 was 
primarily responsible for that shift. 
the striking change in the mode of arrival after 2005 raises important policy questions 
not  just  about  the  need  for  a  2,000-mile  wall,  but  about  the  allocation  of  immigration 
enforcement  resources  and  funding  levels  for  border  enforcement  compared  to  other 
strategies that might reduce new arrivals into the undocumented population and strategies 
to reduce the overall size of this population.4 rather than extending the wall, for example, 
border  enforcement  resources  might  be  better  directed  to  supporting  rule  of  law  and 
economic development initiatives in the northern triangle states of central america, or 
to refugee processing in central america, or to improving the screening of visitors at visa-
issuing posts. such shifts in the allocation of resources would address the primary source 
of undocumented immigration  overstaying temporary visas  and the causes of the 
flight of large numbers of migrants from the violence-plagued northern triangle states to 
the united states and elsewhere.

appendix

methodology

the first part of the appendix describes the data and methods used to estimate the numbers 
presented in this report. the last section examines the sensitivity of the estimates to changes 
in  the  assumptions  and  the  data  used.  in  the  following  discussion,  the  terms  percent 
overstays and overstay rates mean the same thing: estimated overstays divided by total 
undocumented population.
the  estimates  of  the  2014  undocumented  population  used  to  make  these  visa  overstay 
estimates  were  compiled  by  cms  (warren  2016).  specifically,  two  sets  of  data  were 
compiled: (1) estimates of the undocumented population in 2014 cross-classified by state of 
residence and country of origin, and (2) estimates of the 2014 population for each country, 
by single year of entry, from 1982 to 2014. 
as noted above, all but a very small number of ewis are from only six countries  mexico, 
el salvador, guatemala, honduras, nicaragua, and dominican republic. the first step was 
to estimate the percent of undocumented arrivals who overstayed from those six countries 
in 2014, as shown in table a-1 below. 

4   cms has found that a substantial percentage of visa overstays, likely in the range of one-third, leave the 
undocumented population  through voluntary emigration, death, removal, or securing immigration status 
 within five years. 

131

the 2,000 mile wall in search of a purposethe estimated overstays in table a-1, column 1, were compiled by dhs, as described 
in their report (dhs 2015). the figures in columns 2 and 3 are from the cms estimates 
for 2014. in column 4, the averages of the numbers in columns 2 and 3 were computed 
and then adjusted, as shown in the table, to reflect the fact that some of those who arrived 
in 2013 and 2014 would have left the undocumented population between arrival and the 
date of our estimates. the percent overstays in column 5 for each of the six countries was 
computed as the ratio of overstays to total recent arrivals (table a-1).

in5 table a-1, the overstay rates in column 5 refer to arrivals in 2014. it would not be 
appropriate to use these rates for all years of entry because the rates are subject to change 
over time. the estimates in column 5 of table a-1 were used along with an earlier estimate 
of  percent  overstays    16  percent  for  mexico  in  1996    to  derive  the  percent  who 
overstayed in previous years, as described below and as illustrated in table a-2.
table a-2 below shows how the overstay rates were derived for each year of entry. the 
estimates of entries in 2014 are from table a-1, column 5. the figures for 2005 were derived 
on the assumption that the percentages of overstays among all arrivals were considerably 
lower in 2005 than in 2014. the basis for that assumption is the changing relationship 
between overstays and ewis after 2005, as shown in figure 1. until 2005, the two trend 
5    arrivals in 2012 and 2013, as adjusted, were used for 2014 because they were the two most recent full 
years of estimates available. it is possible that arrivals from el salvador, guatemala, and honduras in 2014 
were higher than the numbers shown in table a-1. as shown in table a-5, reasonable alternative data and 
assumptions would have little effect on the final results. for example, increasing the numbers for these three 
countries by 50 percent (that is, the numbers in column 4 of table a-1) would reduce the percentage of 
overstays in the total population in 2014 from 41.6 to 41.2 and reduce the percentage of overstays in florida 
from 61.2 to 60.5 (see table a-5).

132

fundamentally after 2005 as the arrival of ewis fell rapidly and overstays remained fairly 
level (figure 1).

source: 2014 percentages are from table a-1; 2005 percentages assume that 2005 percentages were half 
of  2014  percentages;  percentages  for  2006  to  2013  for  each  country  were  computed  by  extrapolation; 
percentage  for  mexico  in  1996  from warren  (1997);  and,  percentages  for  mexico  from  1997  to  2004 
were  computed  by  extrapolation.  see  the  section  below,  sensitivity  of  the  estimates  to  alternative 
assumptions, to see how changes in these assumptions would affect the estimates of percent overstays.

the rates shown in table a-2 were multiplied by the cms estimates of the undocumented 
population, by single years of entry, to derive the total number of overstays in the 2014 
population. the results are shown in table a-3. about 4.5 million, or almost 42 percent 
of the total undocumented population in 2014, were overstays. the figure for mexico was 
18.4 percent, an increase of 2.4 percentage points over the estimate of 16 percent for 1996 
estimated by warren (1997).

estimates  of  the  percent  overstays  in  each  state  were  derived  by  multiplying  the  rates 
shown in table a-3 by the total number of undocumented residents from each country 
residing in the state in 2014. table a-4 illustrates the computation of percent overstays for 
florida. the same procedure was repeated for every state.

sensitivity of the estimates to alternative assumptions

table a-5 below shows how the estimates presented here would be affected by alternative 
data  or  assumptions. the  estimates  of  percent  overstays  in  the  total  population  and  in 
florida would increase or decrease by just a few percentage points if the rather extreme 
alternative data or assumptions shown in the first column of table a-5 had been used.
