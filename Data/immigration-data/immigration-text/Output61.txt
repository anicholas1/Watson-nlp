integration of unauthorized 
immigrants: a comparison of s. 744 
and irca

 executive summary
experiences  under  the  immigration  reform  and  control  act  of  1986 
(irca)  may  prove  to  be  a  poor  guide  for  understanding  how  smoothly 
todays unauthorized immigrants will integrate into the economy under 
reform proposals such as the border security, economic opportunity, and 
immigration modernization act (s. 744). while irca provided a relatively 
quick path to legal permanent resident status, s. 744 proposes a decade-
long process with much attendant uncertainty. this and other provisions in 
s. 744 may adversely affect immigrants integration and economic mobility. 

the  legalization  of  undocumented  immigrants  is  one  of  the  most  contentious  issues  in 
immigration reform discussions. one proposal emblematic of these discussions is contained 
in  the  border  security,  economic  opportunity,  and  immigration  modernization  act, 
passed by the senate in june 2013 (s. 744). if this bill were to become law, unauthorized 
immigrants would be placed on a 10-year pathway to legalization with citizenship three 
years  after  that.  in  1986,  the  immigration  reform  and  control act  (irca)  provided  a 
pathway to legalization and citizenship to unauthorized immigrants. irca was the first and 
most comprehensive legislation to address the issue of unauthorized immigration in the 
united states, with 2.7 million immigrants becoming legal residents under it (kerwin 2010). 
not surprisingly, irca is commonly used as a point of reference in current immigration 
reform discussions.
research on the potential economic and fiscal effects of the legalization provision of s. 
744 draws heavily from the 1986 irca experience, particularly concerning the expected 
earnings growth and occupational mobility of the would-be legalized. earnings growth and 
upward occupational mobility mean larger benefits for immigrant families as well as larger 
benefits for the economy, larger tax revenues, and less reliance on government programs 
(enchautegui et al. 2013; institute of taxation 2013; lynch and oakford 2013; kossoudji  
and cobb-clark 2002). the irca experience can be used as a guide to the effects of the 

reproduced with permission of the urban institute.jmhs volume 2 number 1 (2014): 1-13proposed legalization program and has been used in several estimates of economic effects 
of legalization (enchautegui et al. 2013). but there are important differences between irca 
and current proposals that impinge on the economic mobility of the would-be legalized. 
this brief seeks to discern what features in legalization proposals enhance or hinder the 
economic contribution and integration of unauthorized immigrants. considering irca and 
the legalization proposal contained in s. 744 as emblematic of legalization programs, this 
brief examines differences between the two, specifically focusing on both the economic 
gains of legalization and the integration of immigrants. other legalization proposals may 
emerge as immigration discussions continue. by comparing irca and s. 744, this brief 
aims to  identify program features that could be used by policy makers and interest groups 
alike in crafting future legalization proposals for unauthorized immigrants. 
the  quick  pathway  to  legal  permanent  residence  in  irca  contrasts  with  the  long  and 
uncertain  pathways  proposed  in  s.  744.  this  brief  contends  that  long  and  uncertain 
pathways to lawful permanent residence, renewals of temporary status, participation of 
employers in adjustments and certifications, and limits to occupational mobilityall of 
which are present in s. 744are hurdles to the economic mobility and contributions of the 
prospective legalized population. this brief also argues that because immigration reform 
bills contain many elements that affect the integration of immigrants, such bills should 
be  conceptualized  as  not  only  immigration  policy  changes  but  also  integration  policy 
interventions. 
certainly, times have changed and irca had its share of problems.1 this brief contends 
not that a program resembling irca should be implemented currently, but that some of 
the provisions of s. 744 not present in irca could be improved to foster the economic 
integration  of  the  would-be  legalized  and  enhance  the  fiscal  and  economic  effects  of 
legalization. looking back, ircas quick pathway to permanent residence was not only 
major immigration policy legislation but also a major immigrant integration policy. as s. 
744 has not yet being passed by congress and the nation continues to debate immigration 
reform, conceptualizing immigration reform bills not only as immigration policy changes 
but immigrant integration policies can help guide the design of legalization programs.

a  comparison  of  irca  and  s.  744  pathways  to  legal 
permanent residence and citizenship
the main legalization features of irca and s. 744 are listed in tables 1, 2, and 3. the 
information on the table focuses on only the most important legalization stipulations and is 
not exhaustive. for example, it does not list provisions related to fees, absences from the 
united states, criminal record, and the filing of a complete application. 
table  1  shows  ircas  and  s.  744s  stipulations  to  qualify  for  temporary  status.  irca

of  mixed-status  families  through  the  absence  of  derivatives  benefits,  gender  bias  in  documentation 
requirements and a lack of attention to future immigration flows (cooper and oneal 2005; baker 1997;

journal on migration and human securitycontained  two  major  programs:  one  for  general  unauthorized  immigrants  and  one  for 
agricultural  workers.2  in  irca,  general  unauthorized  immigrants  who  qualified  were 
granted temporary status if they had arrived in united states before january 1, 1982. under 
the special agricultural worker (saw) program, agricultural workers must have performed 
agricultural work for at least 90 days in the 12 month period ending on may 1, 1986 to 
qualify. temporary status was not extended to spouses and children of petitioners. s. 744 
also  distinguishes  between  general  and  agricultural  immigrants.  general  unauthorized 
immigrants requesting registered provisional immigrant (rpi) status must have arrived by 
december 31, 2011. the blue card program is for certain agricultural workers.  to obtain a 
blue card, agricultural workers must have performed 575 hours or 100 days of agricultural 
work during the two-year period ending on december 31, 2012. both programs extend 
temporary status to spouses and children residing in the united states by december 31, 
2012. 
table  2  shows  the  legislations  stipulations  during  temporary  status.  under  irca,  the 
temporary status could last up to 31 months for general applicants, or one to two years in the 
case of agricultural workers. during the first five years after temporary status was granted, 
the legalized could not receive means-tested federal benefits.3 there was no renewal of 
temporary status. in s. 744, temporary status could last up to 12 years for rpis and up to 8 
years for blue card immigrants. after 6 years, rpis must renew their temporary status. to 
renew, rpis need to have income levels no less than the poverty threshold and will have 
to show proof either of continuous employment without interruptions lasting more than 6 
months or of ongoing education. employers of blue card holders have to submit yearly 
reports to the department of agriculture about the employment of blue card immigrants 
during  their  temporary  status.  neither  rpis  nor  blue  card  immigrants  are  eligible  to 
receive means-tested federal benefits or subsidies for buying health care insurance in the 
exchanges in the affordable care act. 
table  3  shows  the  legislations  stipulations  to  obtain  lawful  permanent  resident  (lpr) 
status  and  citizenship. after  19  months  of  temporary  status,  immigrants  in  the  general 
irca program were eligible for lawful permanent residence. to obtain lawful permanent 
residence, temporary immigrants in the general program had to have minimal knowledge 
of english, us history, and government, or show that they were pursuing education or 
training in these areas. saws were able to obtain lawful permanent residence within one 
to  two  years  after temporary  status  was  granted.  saws  did  not  have  to  show  proof  of 
continued agricultural employment after enactment of the law to receive lawful permanent 
residence. irca had neither employment nor income requirements for it. after 5 years in 
lpr status, irca immigrants could become citizens. 
in s. 744, the pathway to legalization and citizenship differs significantly from ircas 
model.  instead  of  being  rapid  and  clear,  it  is  long  and  uncertain.  under  s.  744,  the 
undocumented immigrant will be under rpi status for ten years before they can apply for 
lawful permanent residence. border security and enforcement requirements have to be met 

2   two  other  programs  of  smaller  scale  contained  in  irca  were  the  registry  granting  legalization  to 
immigrants who arrived to the united states by january 1972 (60,000 applicants) and for cubans and haitians 
who arrived before 1982 (cooper and oneil 2005).   
3  saws restrictions were specific to the program of aid for families with dependent children.

legalization programs and the integration of unauthorized immigrants(also referred to as triggers), but processing of lpr applications must start within 10 years 
if these triggers are not met. after 10 years in rpi status, an application for adjustment to 
lpr can be submitted. however, it is uncertain when these lpr visas will be awarded 
because the visa applications of rpis will be the last applications processedthey cannot 
be awarded until all visa petitions submitted before the enactment of the law have been 
awarded (this is the back of the line provision). to become lprs, rpis must show a 
record of regular employment and show that they are not likely to become a public charge. 
agricultural workers with blue cards can obtain lawful permanent residence in five years. 
they must show employment in agriculture after enactment of the law. specifically, a blue 
card holder could get lpr status in five years if during the five years since enactment of 
the law she or he worked no less than 150 work days in agriculture during each of three 
years.4 blue card holders visa applications are not subject to numerical limitations like 
those of rpis. under s. 744, after 3 years as an lpr, general immigrants can apply for 
citizenship. former blue card holders can become citizens after 5 years as an lpr. 

hurdles  to  economic  benefits  and  integration  of  the 
legalization proposal of s. 744
many studies draw from irca to infer the benefits of legalization for immigrants and 
the  economy  (hinojosa-ojeda  2010;  institute  of  taxation  and  economic  policy  2013; 
lynch  and  oakford  2013;  rector  and  richwine  2013).  however,  s.  744s  long  and 
bumpy pathway to lpr status for rpis, the promise of a visa in five years with continued 
employment in agriculture, and the involvement of employers in the process of renewal 
and lpr application can be hurdles to the economic integration of the would-be legalized. 
there is a link between legal immigration status and the life chances of immigrants, and 
thus between immigration status and integration outcomes (enchautegui 2008; gleeson 
2010; jasso 2011; massey 2007; menjivar 2006). 
in  comparing  irca  legalization  to  the  legalization  proposal  in  s.  744,  the  following 
features could affect the economic contribution and integration of the newly legalized: 
	 long	and	uncertain	period	in	temporary	status	is	a	constraint	to	integration: under 
irca, most newly legalized were legal permanent residents within two years. under s. 
744, the temporary status period for rpis would be ten years, with renewal within six 
years. blue card holders would be in  temporary status for five years. admittedly, legal 
employment and freedom from the threat of deportation are important to undocumented 
workers and their families, offering an improvement over the current law. but temporary 
status is not the same as lawful permanent residence, and the implications for economic 
integration are important. the long period in temporary status, the renewal application 
after six years, and the uncertainty of when one would receive an lpr visa (because of 
back of the line provisions and border enforcement triggers) all hinder immigrants 
economic  integration. although  the  quantitative  empirical  research  is  scarce,  there 
are qualitative studies of central american temporary immigrants in the us, many of 
whom have been in temporary status for years, even decades. these studies find that 

4  since the blue card is valid  for up to eight years (table 2), the worker can get lpr status before 8 years if 
he/she shows that he/she worked 100 days in each of five years over the last 8 years.

journal on migration and human securitytemporary status is ambiguous; it is neither an undocumented status nor a documented 
one, but may have the characteristics of both (menjivar 2006, 1008). menjivar (2006; 
2012) and mountz et al. (2002) describe at length the uncertainties and anxieties of 
these  temporary  status  families,  describing  them  as  in  a  legal  limbo.  temporary 
status has important effects on immigrants sense both of belonging and of their future 
in the united states. as uriarte et. al. (2003, 11) posit in a study of immigrants with 
temporary protected status in the boston area, for persons other than u.s. permanent 
residents, immigration is a reality that must be managed on a daily basis. because 
of the uncertain future it offers, temporary status prevents immigrants from making 
investments  both  small  and  large  (mountz  et  al.  2012).  immigrants  visions  for 
themselves in the host country are important for investment in their own human capital 
and eventual earnings growth (cortes 2004, khan 1997), as well as other investments 
that depend on expectations of permanence in the united states (galor and stark 1991). 
	 the	bureaucracy	of	renewal: another important factor in legalization proposals is 
how administrative and bureaucratic processes affect the target population. s. 744s 
provisions for the  rpi status renewal process directly affect immigrants economic 
opportunities. according to jasso (2011), immigration office personnel and practices
and those offices pervasive problem of lost documentshave significant effects on 
the life chances of immigrants. as a participant in enchautegui and menjivar (2013) 
states: any little thing can cause a problem with the immigration [authorities]. even 
a form for a change of address, if its not perfect, can throw off your case. at times, 
immigrants hesitate to apply for temporary status renewal, because denial is a clear, 
official return to undocumented status, a result many immigrants fear (uriarte et al 
2003). these bureaucratic processes are not unbiased, privileging male immigrants, 
educated immigrants, and foreign-born spouses  of  natives (hagan  and baker 1997; 
jasso 2011; salcido and menjivar 2012). s. 744s temporary status renewal process 
contains hurdles detrimental to the economic success of the would-be legalized, sending 
some back to an undocumented status, delaying renewal for others, and even taking 
some immigrants off of the legalization pathway completely. 

	 employers	role	in	the	pathway	to	legalization. proponents of legalization programs 
should  also  be  wary  of  employers  role  in  status  certifications,  renewals,  and  lpr 
status applications. under s. 744, employers would play a direct role in the pathway to 
legalization of immigrants. rpis have to renew their application in 6 years, conditional 
on employment and an income at or above the poverty line. employment is verified 
again when applying for lpr status (see table 3). for blue card immigrants, employers 
have to provide a yearly employment status report to the us department of agriculture, 
simultaneously providing a copy to the worker. irca did not have similar employer 
involvement for temporary status immigrants.	employer verification for lpr status 
can also place workers in an uneasy relationship with their employers. it is known that 
workers in vulnerable  conditions are less likely to come forward to report injuries 
and safety, wage or hours violations (bernhardt et al. 2009; de castro et al. 2006). 
and while unauthorized immigrants are at extreme vulnerability to these violations 
(bernhardt et al. 2009; enchautegui 2008), temporary status workers are also at high 
risk (sukthankar 2012; gao 2010). allowing employers to play a role in legalization 
may come at the expense of improved wages and working conditions of the immigrants

legalization programs and the integration of unauthorized immigrantsthe program intends to benefit. 

	 family	separation	during	temporary	status: family reunification is a long-standing 
principle  of  us  immigration  policy  and  it  encourages  the  social  and  economic 
integration  of  immigrants  (enchautegui  2013).  legalization  programs  that  prevent 
family  reunification  can  be  detrimental  for  the  well-being  of  immigrants.  under  s. 
744,  temporary  immigrants  cannot  petition  visas  for  immediate  family  members 
residing abroad. this is yet another constraint to economic mobility and integration, 
especially considering the long duration of the temporary status. most rpi immigrants 
will have to wait at least 10 years to petition for such visas. this was not the case 
in  irca,  because  most  immigrants in  this  program  had  received lawful  permanent 
residence within two years of its enactment. family members play a significant role 
in immigrants integration; familial presence expands the availability of resources and 
enables economic mobility. these family members could contribute financially, assist 
in business, or support other family members work (baker and benjamin 1997; duleep 
and regets 1996; sanders and nee 1996). the inability to bring family from abroad 
also takes an emotional and economic toll on immigrants, especially for mothers and 
fathers who send remittances to children and spouses  abroadoften hindering their 
own economic well-being (abrego 2009).

	 locking	immigrants	into	low	paying	jobs: legalization offers formerly undocumented 
immigrants the employment mobility to leave unfair or low-paying jobs (kossoudji 
and cobb-clark 2002). legalization proposals that constrain immigrants job mobility 
can limit overall economic mobility. s. 744 promises permanent residence in five years 
to blue card agricultural workers who continue such work after enactment of the law, 
provided they work no less than 150 work days in agriculture during each of three years 
since enactment of the law.5 irca did not impose agricultural work requirements after 
enactment. it is crucial to note that agricultural jobs are among the lowest-paid jobs in 
the united states. for full-time agricultural workers in 2012, median weekly earnings 
were $435, or 56 percent of the weekly earnings of the average worker.6  poor wages, 
seasonal employment, and poor labor conditions push many agricultural workers to 
pursue other occupations and to increase the time spent on nonfarm work (taylor and 
thilmany 1993; dol 2000; walters et al. 2006). while the s. 744 agricultural work 
requirement is intended to produce a stable and authorized agricultural workforce, it 
may  unintentionally  slow  economic  integration  of  legalized  immigrants  by  locking 
them at low wage levels.

what does this mean for immigration reform?
immigration reform is one of the most debated policy issues in this country. central to it 
is the question of what to do with over 11 million undocumented immigrants currently 

5  since the blue cards are good for up to eight years, the worker can get lpr status before 8 years if he/she 
show that worked 100 days each of five years in the last 8 years or 150 days of agricultural work each of three 
years during the last five years.

journal on migration and human securityin the united states (hofer, rytina, and baker 2012; passel and cohn 2012). because 
irca is often used to analyze the economics of a possible legalization program, this brief 
compares ircas legalization provisions with those in s. 744, which are emblematic of 
current discussions on immigration reform. the goal is to identify features of legalization 
programs that could enhance or hinder the integration of immigrants.
the legalization program in s. 744 is not only a major immigration policy change, but 
also a major integration policy intervention. immigration status is central to the integration 
of  immigrants.    it  affects  legal  rights,  ability  to  sponsor  family  members,  and  access 
employment,  financial  capital,  and  government  benefits  (enchautegui  and  menjvar 
2013). using s. 744 as a guide and comparing it to irca, this brief points to features in 
legalization programs that are hurdles to the economic progress of legalized immigrants. 
irca, by allowing a quick pathway from undocumented to legal resident status, was not 
only a major immigration policy change but also a major integration policy intervention. 
admittedly, s. 744 is better than the current law. however, because this bill is not yet law 
and additional proposals may emerge, there is still an opportunity to discuss a legalization 
proposal that would greater encourage the economic integration of the would-be legalized 
and increase their contribution to the economy. 
a brief period of temporary status is critical for immigrants economic integration. long 
periods in temporary status with no certain outcome, as envisioned in s. 744, would slow 
the economic growth of the would-be legalized and thus dampen the economic benefits 
of  legalization.  immigration  reform  proposals  could  shorten  this  period  and  curb  the 
uncertainty introduced by renewals, back of the line stipulations, and border security 
triggers. reducing the role of employers in immigrants status certifications and adjustment 
could yield better jobs for immigrants. fewer limitations on job mobility and faster family 
reunification also contribute to economic integration. legalization proposals could also 
contain strong language enforcing  regulation of wages, hours, and workplace safety.
there is a close link between immigration status and economic achievement (jasso 2011; 
massey 2007; menjivar 2006). stricter immigration laws such as  increased border security 
measures,  employment  verification  systems,  improved  tracking  of  nonimmigrants,  and 
stronger interior enforcement,  increase the visibility of immigration status, making it a 
stronger differentiator in economic achievement. the temporary statuses proposed as part 
of s. 744 could become another layer of economic disparity unless the changes suggested 
in this brief are considered.
